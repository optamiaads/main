Scripts\nthat follow our best practices will be easier to read, understand and\nmaintain. You can see scripts using these guidelines published from the TradingView and PineCoders accounts on the platform. We recommend the use of: camelCase for all identifiers, i.e., variable or function names: ma , maFast , maLengthInput , maColor , roundedOHLC() , pivotHi() . All caps SNAKE_CASE for constants: BULL_COLOR , BEAR_COLOR , MAX_LOOKBACK . The use of qualifying suffixes when it provides valuable clues about\nthe type or provenance of a variable: maShowInput , bearColor , bearColorInput , volumesArray , maPlotID , resultsTable , levelsColorArray . The Pine Script® compiler is quite forgiving of the positioning of\nspecific statements or the version compiler annotation in the script. While other arrangements are syntactically\ncorrect, this is how we recommend organizing scripts: If you publish your open-source scripts publicly on TradingView (scripts\ncan also be published privately), your open-source code is by default\nprotected by the Mozilla license. You may choose any other license you\nprefer. The reuse of code from those scripts is governed by our House Rules on\nScript\nPublishing which preempt the author’s license. The standard license comments appearing at the beginning of scripts are: // This source code is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License 2.0 at https://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/\n// © username This is the compiler annotation defining the version of Pine Script the script will use. If\nnone is present, v1 is used. For v6, use: //@version=6 This is the mandatory declaration statement which defines the type of\nyour script. It must be a call to either indicator() , strategy() ,\nor library() . If your script uses one or more Pine Script libraries , your import statements belong here. Scripts can declare variables qualified as “const”, i.e., ones\nreferencing a constant value. We refer to variables as “constants” when they meet these criteria: Their declaration uses the optional const keyword (see our User\nManual’s section on type qualifiers for more information). They are initialized using a literal (e.g., 100 or \"AAPL\" ) or a\nbuilt-in qualified as “const” (e.g., color.green ). Their value does not change during the script’s execution. We use SNAKE_CASE to name these variables and group their declaration\nnear the top of the script. For example: // ————— Constants\nint MS_IN_MIN = 60 * 1000\nint MS_IN_HOUR = MS_IN_MIN * 60\nint MS_IN_DAY = MS_IN_HOUR * 24 color GRAY = #808080ff\ncolor LIME = #00FF00ff\ncolor MAROON = #800000ff\ncolor ORANGE = #FF8000ff\ncolor PINK = #FF0080ff\ncolor TEAL = #008080ff\ncolor BG_DIV = color.new(ORANGE, 90)\ncolor BG_RESETS = color.new(GRAY, 90) string RST1 = \"No reset; cumulate since the beginning of the chart\"\nstring RST2 = \"On a stepped higher timeframe (HTF)\"\nstring RST3 = \"On a fixed HTF\"\nstring RST4 = \"At a fixed time\"\nstring RST5 = \"At the beginning of the regular session\"\nstring RST6 = \"At the first visible chart bar\"\nstring RST7 = \"Fixed rolling period\" string LTF1 = \"Least precise, covering many chart bars\"\nstring LTF2 = \"Less precise, covering some chart bars\"\nstring LTF3 = \"More precise, covering less chart bars\"\nstring LTF4 = \"Most precise, 1min intrabars\" string TT_TOTVOL = \"The 'Bodies' value is the transparency of the total volume candle bodies. Zero is opaque, 100 is transparent.\"\nstring TT_RST_HTF = \"This value is used when '\" + RST3 +\"' is selected.\"\nstring TT_RST_TIME = \"These values are used when '\" + RST4 +\"' is selected. A reset will occur when the time is greater or equal to the bar's open time, and less than its close time.\\nHour: 0-23\\nMinute: 0-59\"\nstring TT_RST_PERIOD = \"This value is used when '\" + RST7 +\"' is selected.\" In this example: The RST* and LTF* constants will be used as tuple elements in\nthe options argument of input.*() calls. The TT_* constants will be used as tooltip arguments in input.*() calls. Note how we use a line continuation for long\nstring literals. We do not use var to initialize constants. The Pine Script runtime is optimized to\nhandle declarations on each bar, but using var to initialize a variable only the first time it is declared incurs a\nminor penalty on script performance because of the maintenance that var variables require on further bars. Note that: Literals used in more than one place in a script should always be\ndeclared as a constant. Using the constant rather than the literal\nmakes it more readable if it is given a meaningful name, and the\npractice makes code easier to maintain. Even though the quantity of\nmilliseconds in a day is unlikely to change in the future, MS_IN_DAY is more meaningful than 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 . Constants only used in the local block of a function or if , while ,\netc., statement for example, can be declared in that local block. It is much easier to read scripts when all their inputs are in the\nsame code section. Placing that section at the beginning of the script\nalso reflects how they are processed at runtime, i.e., before the rest\nof the script is executed. Suffixing input variable names with input makes them more readily\nidentifiable when they are used later in the script: maLengthInput , bearColorInput , showAvgInput , etc. // ————— Inputs\nstring resetInput = input.string(RST2, \"CVD Resets\", inline = \"00\", options = [RST1, RST2, RST3, RST4, RST5, RST6, RST7])\nstring fixedTfInput = input.timeframe(\"D\", \" Fixed HTF: \", tooltip = TT_RST_HTF)\nint hourInput = input.int(9, \" Fixed time hour: \", inline = \"01\", minval = 0, maxval = 23)\nint minuteInput = input.int(30, \"minute\", inline = \"01\", minval = 0, maxval = 59, tooltip = TT_RST_TIME)\nint fixedPeriodInput = input.int(20, \" Fixed period: \", inline = \"02\", minval = 1, tooltip = TT_RST_PERIOD)\nstring ltfModeInput = input.string(LTF3, \"Intrabar precision\", inline = \"03\", options = [LTF1, LTF2, LTF3, LTF4]) All user-defined functions must be defined in the script’s global\nscope; nested function definitions are not allowed in Pine Script. Optimal function design should minimize the use of global variables in\nthe function’s scope, as they undermine function portability. When it\ncan’t be avoided, those functions must follow the global variable\ndeclarations in the code, which entails they can’t always be placed in\nthe <function_declarations> section. Such dependencies on global\nvariables should ideally be documented in the function’s comments. It will also help readers if you document the function’s objective,\nparameters and result. The same syntax used in libraries can be used to\ndocument your functions. This can make it easier to port your functions\nto a library should you ever decide to do so: //@version=6\nindicator(\"<function_declarations>\", \"\", true) string SIZE_LARGE = \"Large\"\nstring SIZE_NORMAL = \"Normal\"\nstring SIZE_SMALL = \"Small\" string sizeInput = input.string(SIZE_NORMAL, \"Size\", options = [SIZE_LARGE, SIZE_NORMAL, SIZE_SMALL]) // @function Used to produce an argument for the `size` parameter in built-in functions.\n// @param userSize (simple string) User-selected size.\n// @returns One of the `size.*` built-in constants.\n// Dependencies SIZE_LARGE, SIZE_NORMAL, SIZE_SMALL\ngetSize(simple string userSize) => result = switch userSize SIZE_LARGE => size.large SIZE_NORMAL => size.normal SIZE_SMALL => size.small => size.auto if ta.rising(close, 3) label.new(bar_index, na, yloc = yloc.abovebar, style = label.style_arrowup, size = getSize(sizeInput)) This is where the script’s core calculations and logic should be\nplaced. Code can be easier to read when variable declarations are placed\nnear the code segment using the variables. Some programmers prefer to\nplace all their non-constant variable declarations at the beginning of\nthis section, which is not always possible for all variables, as some\nmay require some calculations to have been executed before their\ndeclaration. Strategies are easier to read when strategy calls are grouped in the\nsame section of the script. This section should ideally include all the statements producing the\nscript’s visuals, whether they be plots, drawings, background colors,\ncandle-plotting, etc. See the Pine Script user manual’s section on here for more\ninformation on how the relative depth of visuals is determined. Alert code will usually require the script’s calculations to have\nexecuted before it, so it makes sense to put it at the end of the\nscript. A space should be used on both sides of all operators, except unary\noperators ( -1 ). A space is also recommended after all commas and when\nusing named function arguments, as in plot(series = close) : int a = close > open ? 1 : -1\nvar int newLen = 2\nnewLen := min(20, newlen + 1)\nfloat a = -b\nfloat c = d > e ? d - e : d\nint index = bar_index % 2 == 0 ? 1 : 2\nplot(close, color = color.red) Line wrapping can make long lines easier to read. Line wraps are defined\nby using an indentation level that is not a multiple of four, as four\nspaces or a tab are used to define local blocks. Here we use two spaces: plot( series = close, title = \"Close\", color = color.blue, show_last = 10 ) Vertical alignment using tabs or spaces can be useful in code sections\ncontaining many similar lines such as constant declarations or inputs.\nThey can make mass edits much easier using the Pine Editor’s\nmulti-cursor feature ( ctrl + alt + 🠅 ): // Colors used as defaults in inputs.\ncolor COLOR_AQUA = #0080FFff\ncolor COLOR_BLACK = #000000ff\ncolor COLOR_BLUE = #013BCAff\ncolor COLOR_CORAL = #FF8080ff\ncolor COLOR_GOLD = #CCCC00ff Including the type of variables when declaring them is not required.\nHowever, it helps make scripts easier to read, navigate, and understand.\nIt can help clarify the expected types at each point in a script’s\nexecution and distinguish a variable’s declaration (using = ) from its\nreassignments (using := ). Using explicit typing can also make scripts\neasier to debug ."}]}
