# 🔍 Strategy Dev & Debug for Codex/LLM Collaboration

## 📘 Overview

This repository is a collaborative workspace designed to streamline the development, debugging, and optimization of trading strategy code using OpenAI Codex, ChatGPT, and other LLM tools. The primary focus is on Pine Script v6 (TradingView) and NinjaScript (NinjaTrader 8), but it's flexible for broader automation and scripting integration.

---

## 💡 Purpose

* Assist in creating high-quality, executable Pine Script v6 and NinjaScript NT8 code.
* Maintain a robust feedback and error-resolution cycle via LLM-guided debugging.
* Document each step of the development journey with strategy snapshots, logs, and error fixes.

---

## 🧠 Key Features

* **Codex-LLM Strategy Code Co-Authoring:** All strategies originate or are refined with AI collaboration.
* **Error Knowledge Base Integration:** Auto-validation against known issues (`pine_error_log.*` and `README_PineScript_Error_KB.md`).
* **Code Snapshots & Versioning:** Contains .pdfs and source files of each EMA variant (e.g., `ema 21`, `ema 50`, `ema 200`).
* **Structured Primer Resources:** Onboarding documents like “First steps”, “First indicator”, and built-in language features to accelerate learning.
