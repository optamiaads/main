We’ve added ability to export constants from libraries. Now you can use export declaration with the ‘const int’, ‘const float’, ‘const bool’, ‘const color’, or ‘const string’ type, e.g: export const float my_pi = 3.15 The time_close variable and the time_close() function have improved behavior on tick charts and price-based charts ( Renko , line break , Kagi , point & figure , and range ). On chart types that are not time-based, the closing time of the open realtime bar is knowable only after the bar closes. Therefore, the value of time_close and time_close() is always na for that bar. Previously, it was impossible to use expressions such as time_close[1] or time_close(\"\", 1) to retrieve the closing timestamp of an elapsed realtime bar on these chart types. These expressions always returned na when they referenced a realtime bar, because the bar’s timestamp was not saved after the closing tick. With this new update, the closing timestamp of a realtime bar on tick charts or price-based charts is always available immediately after the bar closes. Now, scripts can use time_close with the [] history-referencing operator or call time_close() with a positive bars_back argument to retrieve the closing times of elapsed realtime bars on any chart type. For example: //@version=6 indicator(\"Previous closing time\") // Plot the `time_close[1]` value, representing the UNIX timestamp of the past bar's closing time. // This plot used to show `na` on all realtime bars of tick charts and price-based charts. plot(time_close[1], \"Previous bar's closing timestamp\") The style parameter of the ticker.renko() , ticker.pointfigure() , and ticker.kagi() functions accepts a new argument for box sizing: \"PercentageLTP\" . When a call to these functions uses this style argument, the returned ticker ID refers to a non-standard chart dataset with box sizes based on a user-defined percentage of the last trading price. We’ve added a setter function for boxes: box.set_xloc() . It is similar to the *.set_xloc() functions for lines and labels. The function sets the left and right coordinates of the box borders, and defines whether their values represent bar indices or UNIX timestamps. The for loop structure has updated boundary-checking behavior. Previously, any for statement established the loop counter’s end boundary ( to_num ) before starting the first iteration, and the final possible counter value could not change during the loop’s execution. Changing the result of an expression used as a for loop’s to_num argument inside the local scope did not affect the loop’s iteration range. Now, a for loop evaluates the to_num boundary dynamically , before every iteration . With this update, the loop statement can modify its stopping condition after any change to the to_num argument’s result across iterations. To learn more about this new behavior, refer to the `for` loops section of the Loops page and the Dynamic `for` loop boundaries section of the v6 migration guide . We’ve removed the scope count limit. Previously, any script’s total number of scopes, including the global scope and all local scopes from user-defined functions and methods , loops , conditional structures , user-defined types , and enums , was limited to 550. Now, scripts can contain an indefinite number of local scopes from these structures. We’ve introduced two new built-in variables, bid and ask , providing access to real-time market prices: bid - represents the highest price an active buyer is willing to pay for the instrument at its current value. ask - represents the lowest price an active seller will accept for the instrument at its current value. These variables are only available on the \"1T\" timeframe. On other timeframes, their values are na . The strategy.exit() function has updated calculation behaviors. Previously, calls to this command with arguments for the absolute and relative parameters defining a price level for the same exit order always prioritized the absolute parameter and ignored the relative one. For example, a call with specified limit and profit values always ignored the profit value. Now, the command evaluates both related parameters and uses the level that the market price is expected to activate first . See this section of the v6 migration guide for more information. Pine Script has graduated to v6! Starting today, future Pine updates will apply exclusively to this version. Therefore, we recommend converting existing v5 scripts to access new features as we roll them out. See our migration guide to understand the changes to existing Pine behaviors and learn how to convert scripts to v6. Several new features and behaviors come with this version’s release: Scripts can now call request.*() functions with “series string” arguments for the parameters that define the requested context, meaning a single request.*() call can change its requested data feed on any historical bar. Additionally, it is now possible to call request.*() functions inside the local scopes of loops , conditional structures , and exported library functions. See the Dynamic requests section of the Other timeframes and data page to learn more. Values of the “bool” type are now strictly true or false . They are never na in v6. Additionally, the or and and operators now feature short-circuit (“lazy”) evaluation. If the first expression of an or operation is true , or the first expression of an and operation is false , the script does not evaluate the second expression because it is not necessary to determine the result. These improvements help boost the runtime efficiency of scripts that rely on “bool” values and conditional expressions. The size property of labels and the text_size property of boxes and tables now support “int” values in addition to the size.* constants. These “int” values represent sizes in typographic points , offering a more granular and wide range of text size possibilities. The new text_formatting parameter of the label.new() , box.new() , and table.cell() functions determines whether the object’s displayed text is bold , italicized , or both . It accepts one of these three new text.* constants: text.format_bold , text.format_italic , text.format_none . To modify a drawing object’s text_formatting property, use the corresponding *set_text_formatting() functions. Strategies no longer stop calculating and raise an error when they reach the 9000 trade limit while not using Deep Backtesting mode. Instead, they trim the oldest orders to make space for new ones. The trimmed orders are not visible in the Strategy Tester , but that does not change the strategy’s simulation. To retrieve the trade index of the earliest non-trimmed order, use the strategy.closedtrades.first_index variable. The array.get() , array.set() , array.insert() , and array.remove() functions now support negative index arguments to reference elements starting from the end of an array . For instance, the call array.get(myArray, -2) retrieves the second to last element in myArray , which is equivalent to array.get(myArray, array.size(myArray) - 2) . The new syminfo.mincontract variable holds a value representing the smallest number of contracts/shares/lots/units required to trade the current symbol, as set by the exchange. Two new variables, syminfo.main_tickerid and timeframe.main_period , reference the ticker ID and timeframe from the script’s main context , even if the script uses them in the expression argument of a request.*() call. Here, “main context” refers to the current chart’s symbol and timeframe, unless the script is an indicator() that includes symbol or timeframe arguments in its declaration statement. We’ve added an optional behind_chart parameter to the indicator() and strategy() functions. This parameter specifies where plots and drawings appear relative to the main chart display when the overlay parameter is true . If behind_chart is true , the script’s visuals appear behind the chart display. If false , they appear in front of the chart display. The default is true . The ticker.new() and ticker.modify() functions feature two new parameters: settlement_as_close and backadjustment . Users can specify whether these parameters are on, off, or set to inherit the symbol’s default settings. These settings only affect the data from futures symbols with these options available on their charts. They have no effect on other symbols. The Sharpe and Sortino ratios in the Strategy Tester module have updated calculations. Previously, the ratios used strategy returns over monthly periods if the trading range was three or more months and daily periods if the range was three or more days but less than three months. Both ratios now always use monthly periods for consistency. We’ve added a new parameter to the box.new() , label.new() , line.new() , polyline.new() , and table.new() functions: force_overlay - If true, the drawing will display on the main chart pane, even when the script occupies a separate pane. Optional. The default is false. Enums, also known as enumerations , enumerated types , or enum types , are unique data types with all possible values declared by the programmer. They can help programmers maintain more strict control over the values allowed by variables, conditional expressions, and collections , and they enable convenient dropdown input creation with the new input.enum() function. See our User Manual’s Enums page to learn more about these new types and how to use them. We’ve added an optional calc_bars_count parameter to the indicator() , strategy() , request.security() , request.security_lower_tf() , and request.seed() functions that allows users to limit the number of recent historical bars a script or data request can execute across. When a script’s indicator() or strategy() declaration statement includes a calc_bars_count argument, its “Settings/Inputs” tab will include a “Calculated bars” input in the “Calculation” section. The default value in all these functions is 0, which signifies that the script or request executes across all the available data. The strategy.* namespace features several new built-in variables: strategy.avg_trade -\nReturns the average amount of money gained or lost per trade.\nCalculated as the sum of all profits and losses divided by the\nnumber of closed trades. strategy.avg_trade_percent -\nReturns the average percentage gain or loss per trade. Calculated as\nthe sum of all profit and loss percentages divided by the number of\nclosed trades. strategy.avg_winning_trade -\nReturns the average amount of money gained per winning trade.\nCalculated as the sum of profits divided by the number of winning\ntrades. strategy.avg_winning_trade_percent -\nReturns the average percentage gain per winning trade. Calculated as\nthe sum of profit percentages divided by the number of winning\ntrades. strategy.avg_losing_trade -\nReturns the average amount of money lost per losing trade.\nCalculated as the sum of losses divided by the number of losing\ntrades. strategy.avg_losing_trade_percent -\nReturns the average percentage loss per losing trade. Calculated as\nthe sum of loss percentages divided by the number of losing trades. Our new Pine Profiler is a powerful utility that analyzes the executions of all\nsignificant code in a script and displays helpful performance\ninformation next to the code lines inside the Pine Editor. The Profiler ’s information provides insight into a script’s runtime,\nthe distribution of runtime across significant code regions, and the\nnumber of times each code region executes. With these insights,\nprogrammers can effectively pinpoint performance bottlenecks and\nensure they focus on optimizing their code where it truly matters when they need to improve\nexecution times. See the new Profiling and optimization page to learn more about the Profiler, how it works, and how\nto use it to analyze a script’s performance and identify optimization\nopportunities. When opening the detached Pine Editor from a tab with a chart, it now\nlinks directly to that tab, as indicated by the “Linked” status and\ngreen icon in the bottom-right corner. While linked, the “Add to\nchart”, “Update on chart”, and “Apply to entire layout” buttons\naffect the charts on the main tab. The detached Pine Editor now includes the Pine console. We’ve added a new parameter to the plot() , plotchar() , plotcandle() , plotbar() , plotarrow() , plotshape() ,\nand bgcolor() functions: force_overlay - If true, the output will display on the main chart\npane, even when the script occupies a separate pane. The syminfo.* namespace features a new built-in variable: syminfo.expiration_date -\nOn non-continuous futures symbols, returns a UNIX timestamp\nrepresenting the start of the last day of the current contract. The time() and time_close() functions have a new parameter: bars_back - If specified, the function will calculate the\ntimestamp from the bar N bars back relative to the current bar on\nits timeframe. It can also calculate the expected time of a future\nbar up to 500 bars away if the argument is a negative value.\nOptional. The default is 0. We’ve added two new functions for working with strings: str.repeat() -\nConstructs a new string containing the source string repeated a\nspecified number of times with a separator injected between each\nrepeated instance. str.trim() -\nConstructs a new string with all consecutive whitespaces and other\ncontrol characters removed from the left and right of the source\nstring. The request.financial() function now accepts “D” as a period argument, allowing scripts to\nrequest available daily financial data. For example: //@version=5\nindicator(\"Daily financial data demo\") //@variable The daily Premium/Discount to Net Asset Value for \"AMEX:SPY\"\nfloat f1 = request.financial(\"AMEX:SPY\", \"NAV\", \"D\")\nplot(f1) The strategy.* namespace features a new variable for monitoring\navailable capital in a strategy’s simulation: The syminfo.* namespace features new built-in variables: Syminfo: Target price: Recommendations: We’ve added format and precision parameters to all plot*() functions, allowing indicators and strategies to selectively apply\nformatting and decimal precision settings to plotted results in the\nchart pane’s y-axis, the script’s status line, and the Data Window.\nThe arguments passed to these parameters supersede the values in the indicator() and strategy() functions. Both are optional. The defaults for these parameters are the\nsame as the values specified in the script’s declaration statement. For example: //@version=5\nindicator(\"My script\", format = format.percent, precision = 4) plot(close, format = format.price) // Price format with 4-digit precision.\nplot(100 * bar_index / close, precision = 2) // Percent format with 2-digit precision. We’ve added the following variables and functions to the strategy.* namespace: strategy.grossloss_percent -\nThe total gross loss value of all completed losing trades, expressed\nas a percentage of the initial capital. strategy.grossprofit_percent -\nThe total gross profit value of all completed winning trades,\nexpressed as a percentage of the initial capital. strategy.max_runup_percent -\nThe maximum rise from a trough in the equity curve, expressed as a\npercentage of the trough value. strategy.max_drawdown_percent -\nThe maximum drop from a peak in the equity curve, expressed as a\npercentage of the peak value. strategy.netprofit_percent -\nThe total value of all completed trades, expressed as a percentage\nof the initial capital. strategy.openprofit_percent -\nThe current unrealized profit or loss for all open positions,\nexpressed as a percentage of realized equity. strategy.closedtrades.max_drawdown_percent() -\nReturns the maximum drawdown of the closed trade, i.e., the maximum\npossible loss during the trade, expressed as a percentage. strategy.closedtrades.max_runup_percent() -\nReturns the maximum run-up of the closed trade, i.e., the maximum\npossible profit during the trade, expressed as a percentage. strategy.closedtrades.profit_percent() -\nReturns the profit/loss value of the closed trade, expressed as a\npercentage. Losses are expressed as negative values. strategy.opentrades.max_drawdown_percent() -\nReturns the maximum drawdown of the open trade, i.e., the maximum\npossible loss during the trade, expressed as a percentage. strategy.opentrades.max_runup_percent() -\nReturns the maximum run-up of the open trade, i.e., the maximum\npossible profit during the trade, expressed as a percentage. strategy.opentrades.profit_percent() -\nReturns the profit/loss of the open trade, expressed as a\npercentage. Losses are expressed as negative values. Polylines are drawings that sequentially connect the coordinates from an array of up to 10,000 chart points using straight or curved line segments, allowing scripts\nto draw custom formations that are difficult or impossible to achieve\nusing line or box objects. To learn more about this new drawing type, see the Polylines section of our User Manual’s page on Lines and boxes . New functions were added: strategy.default_entry_qty() -\nCalculates the default quantity, in units, of an entry order from strategy.entry() or strategy.order() if it were to fill at the specified fill_price value. chart.point.new() -\nCreates a new chart.point object with the specified time , index , and price . request.seed() -\nRequests data from a user-maintained GitHub repository and returns\nit as a series. An in-depth tutorial on how to add new data can be\nfound here . ticker.inherit() -\nConstructs a ticker ID for the specified symbol with additional\nparameters inherited from the ticker ID passed into the function\ncall, allowing the script to request a symbol’s data using the same\nmodifiers that the from_tickerid has, including extended session,\ndividend adjustment, currency conversion, non-standard chart types,\nback-adjustment, settlement-as-close, etc. timeframe.from_seconds() -\nConverts a specified number of seconds into a valid timeframe\nstring based on our timeframe specification\nformat . The dividends.* namespace now includes variables for retrieving future\ndividend information: dividends.future_amount -\nReturns the payment amount of the upcoming dividend in the currency\nof the current instrument, or na if this data isn’t available. dividends.future_ex_date -\nReturns the Ex-dividend date (Ex-date) of the current instrument’s\nnext dividend payment, or na if this data isn’t available. dividends.future_pay_date -\nReturns the Payment date (Pay date) of the current instrument’s\nnext dividend payment, or na if this data isn’t available. The request.security_lower_tf() function has a new parameter: ignore_invalid_timeframe - Determines how the function behaves\nwhen the chart’s timeframe is smaller than the timeframe value in\nthe function call. If false , the function will raise a runtime\nerror and halt the script’s execution. If true , the function will\nreturn na without raising an error. Users can now explicitly declare variables with the const , simple ,\nand series type qualifiers, allowing more precise control over the\ntypes of variables in their scripts. For example: //@version=5\nindicator(\"My script\") //@variable A constant `string` used as the `title` in the `plot()` function.\nconst string plotTitle = \"My plot\"\n//@variable An `int` variable whose value is consistent after the first chart bar.\nsimple int a = 10\n//@variable An `int` variable whose value can change on every bar.\nseries int b = bar_index plot(b % a, title = plotTitle) Added the following alert placeholders : {{syminfo.currency}} - Returns the currency code of the current\nsymbol (“EUR”, “USD”, etc.). {{syminfo.basecurrency}} - Returns the base currency code of the\ncurrent symbol if the symbol refers to a currency pair. Otherwise,\nit returns na . For example, it returns “EUR” when the symbol is\n“EURUSD”. Maps are collections that hold elements in the form of key-value\npairs . They associate unique keys of a fundamental type with values\nof a built-in or user-defined type. Unlike arrays ,\nthese collections are unordered and do not utilize an internal lookup\nindex. Instead, scripts access the values of maps by referencing the keys from the key-value pairs put into them. For more information on\nthese new collections, see our User Manual’s page on Maps . Fixed an issue that caused strategies to occasionally calculate the\nsizes of limit orders incorrectly due to improper tick rounding of the limit price. Added a new built-in variable to the strategy.* namespace: New syminfo.* built-in variables were added: A new display parameter for all input.*() functions was added.\nIt provides you with more control over the display of input values next to a script’s name.\nFour arguments can be used: display.status_line , display.data_window , display.all ,\nand display.none .\nCombinations of these arguments using plus or minus signs are allowed, and regardless of the argument used,\ninput values will always continue to appear in the Inputs tab of the script’s settings. New parameter added to the strategy.entry() , strategy.order() , strategy.close() , strategy.close_all() ,\nand strategy.exit() functions: disable_alert - Disables order fill alerts for any orders placed\nby the function. Our “Indicator on indicator” feature, which allows a script to pass\nanother indicator’s plot as a source value via the input.source() function, now supports multiple external inputs. Scripts can use a\nmultitude of external inputs originating from up to 10 different\nindicators. We’ve added the following array functions: array.every() -\nReturns true if all elements of the id array are true , false otherwise. array.some() -\nReturns true if at least one element of the id array is true , false otherwise. These functions also work with arrays of int and float types, in which case zero values are considered false , and all others true . Fixed an issue with trailing stops in strategy.exit() being filled on high/low prices rather than on intrabar prices. Fixed behavior of array.mode() , matrix.mode() and ta.mode() .\nNow these functions will return the smallest value when the data has no\nmost frequent value. It is now possible to use seconds-based timeframe strings for the timeframe parameter in request.security() and request.security_lower_tf() . A new function was added: request.currency_rate() -\nprovides a daily rate to convert a value expressed in the from currency to another in the to currency. Pine Script methods are specialized functions associated with specific\ninstances of built-in or user-defined types. They offer a more\nconvenient syntax than standard functions, as users can access methods\nin the same way as object fields using the handy dot notation syntax.\nPine Script includes built-in methods for array , matrix , line , linefill , label , box ,\nand table types and facilitates user-defined methods with the new method keyword. For more details on this new feature, see our User Manual’s page on methods . New array functions were added: Pine objects are instantiations of the new user-defined composite types\n(UDTs) declared using the type keyword. Experienced programmers can think of UDTs as method-less\nclasses. They allow users to create custom types that organize different\nvalues under one logical entity. A detailed rundown of the new\nfunctionality can be found in our User Manual’s page on\nobjects . A new function was added: ticker.standard() -\nCreates a ticker to request data from a standard chart that is\nunaffected by modifiers like extended session, dividend adjustment,\ncurrency conversion, and the calculations of non-standard chart\ntypes: Heikin Ashi, Renko, etc. New strategy.* functions were added: Fixed behaviour of math.round_to_mintick() function. For ‘na’ values it returns ‘na’. Pine Script now has a new, more powerful and better-integrated editor.\nRead our\nblog to find out everything to know about all the new features and upgrades. New overload for the fill() function was added. Now it can create vertical gradients. More info\nabout it in the blog\npost . A new function was added: str.format_time() -\nConverts a timestamp to a formatted string using the specified\nformat and time zone. The text_font_family parameter now allows the selection of a monospace\nfont in label.new() , box.new() and table.cell() function calls, which makes it easier to align text vertically. Its\narguments can be: The accompanying setter functions are: A new label style label.style_text_outline was added. A new parameter for the ta.pivot_point_levels() function was added: developing - If false , the values are those calculated the last\ntime the anchor condition was true. They remain constant until the\nanchor condition becomes true again. If true , the pivots are\ndeveloping, i.e., they constantly recalculate on the data developing\nbetween the point of the last anchor (or bar zero if the anchor\ncondition was never true) and the current bar. Cannot be true when type is set to \"Woodie\" . A new parameter for the box.new() function was added: text_wrap - It defines whether the text is presented in a single\nline, extending past the width of the box if necessary, or wrapped\nso every line is no wider than the box itself. This parameter supports two arguments: New built-in functions were added: ta.min() -\nReturns the all-time low value of source from the beginning of the\nchart up to the current bar. ta.max() -\nReturns the all-time high value of source from the beginning of\nthe chart up to the current bar. A new annotation //@strategy_alert_message was added. If the\nannotation is added to the strategy, the text written after it will be\nautomatically set as the default alert message in the [Create\nAlert] window. //@version=5\n// @strategy_alert_message My Default Alert Message\nstrategy(\"My Strategy\")\nplot(close) It is now possible to fine-tune where a script’s plot values are\ndisplayed through the introduction of new arguments for the display parameter of the plot() , plotchar() , plotshape() , plotarrow() , plotcandle() ,\nand plotbar() functions. Four new arguments were added, complementing the previously available display.all and display.none : display.data_window displays the plot values in the Data Window, one of the items\navailable from the chart’s right sidebar. display.pane displays the plot in the pane where the script resides, as defined\nin with the overlay parameter of the script’s indicator() , strategy() ,\nor library() declaration statement. display.price_scale controls the display of the plot’s label and price in the price\nscale, if the chart’s settings allow them. display.status_line displays the plot values in the script’s status line, next to the\nscript’s name on the chart, if the chart’s settings allow them. The display parameter supports the addition and subtraction of its\narguments: display.all - display.status_line will display the plot’s\ninformation everywhere except in the script’s status line. display.price_scale + display.status_line will display the plot in\nthe price scale and status line only. The behavior of the argument used with the qty_percent parameter of strategy.exit() has changed. Previously, the percentages used on successive exit orders\nof the same position were calculated from the remaining position at any\ngiven time. Instead, the percentages now always apply to the initial\nposition size. When executing the following strategy, for example: //@version=5\nstrategy(\"strategy.exit() example\", overlay = true)\nstrategy.entry(\"Long\", strategy.long, qty = 100)\nstrategy.exit(\"Exit Long1\", \"Long\", trail_points = 50, trail_offset = 0, qty_percent = 20)\nstrategy.exit(\"Exit Long2\", \"Long\", trail_points = 100, trail_offset = 0, qty_percent = 20) 20% of the initial position will be closed on each strategy.exit() call. Before, the first call would exit 20% of the initial position, and\nthe second would exit 20% of the remaining 80% of the position, so only\n16% of the initial position. Two new parameters for the built-in ta.vwap() function were added: anchor - Specifies the condition that triggers the reset of VWAP\ncalculations. When true , calculations reset; when false ,\ncalculations proceed using the values accumulated since the previous\nreset. stdev_mult - If specified, the ta.vwap() calculates the standard deviation bands based on the main VWAP\nseries and returns a [vwap, upper_band, lower_band] tuple. New overloaded versions of the strategy.close() and strategy.close_all() functions with the immediately parameter. When immediately is set to true , the closing order will be executed on the tick where it has been\nplaced, ignoring the strategy parameters that restrict the order\nexecution to the open of the next bar. New built-in functions were added: timeframe.change() -\nReturns true on the first bar of a new timeframe , false otherwise. ta.pivot_point_levels() -\nReturns a float array with numerical values representing 11 pivot\npoint levels: [P, R1, S1, R2, S2, R3, S3, R4, S4, R5, S5] . Levels\nabsent from the specified type return na values. New built-in variables were added: Matrix support has been added to the request.security() function. The historical states of arrays and matrices can now be referenced with the [] operator. In the example below, we reference the historic state of a\nmatrix 10 bars ago: //@version=5\nindicator(\"matrix.new<float> example\")\nm = matrix.new<float>(1, 1, close)\nfloat x = na\nif bar_index > 10 x := matrix.get(m[10], 0, 0)\nplot(x)\nplot(close) The ta.change() function now can take values of int and bool types as its source parameter and return the difference in the\nrespective type. New built-in variables were added: chart.bg_color -\nReturns the color of the chart’s background from the \"Chart settings/Appearance/Background\" field. chart.fg_color -\nReturns a color providing optimal contrast with chart.bg_color . chart.is_standard -\nReturns true if the chart type is bars, candles, hollow candles,\nline, area or baseline, false otherwise. currency.USDT -\nA constant for the Tether currency code. New functions were added: syminfo.prefix() -\nreturns the exchange prefix of the symbol passed to it, e.g.\n“NASDAQ” for “NASDAQ:AAPL”. syminfo.ticker() -\nreturns the ticker of the symbol passed to it without the exchange\nprefix, e.g. “AAPL” for “NASDAQ:AAPL”. request.security_lower_tf() -\nrequests data from a lower timeframe than the chart’s. Added use_bar_magnifier parameter for the strategy() function. When true , the Broker\nEmulator uses lower timeframe data during history backtesting to achieve more\nrealistic results. Fixed behaviour of strategy.exit() function when stop loss triggered at prices outside the bars price\nrange. Added new comment and alert message parameters for the strategy.exit() function: comment_profit - additional notes on the order if the exit was\ntriggered by crossing profit or limit specifically. comment_loss - additional notes on the order if the exit was\ntriggered by crossing stop or loss specifically. comment_trailing - additional notes on the order if the exit was\ntriggered by crossing trail_offset specifically. alert_profit - text that will replace the '{{strategy.order.alert_message}}' placeholder if the exit was\ntriggered by crossing profit or limit specifically. alert_loss - text that will replace the '{{strategy.order.alert_message}}' placeholder if the exit was\ntriggered by crossing stop or loss specifically. alert_trailing - text that will replace the '{{strategy.order.alert_message}}' placeholder if the exit was\ntriggered by crossing trail_offset specifically. Added the display parameter to the following functions: barcolor , bgcolor , fill , hline . A new function was added: request.economic() -\nEconomic data includes information such as the state of a country’s\neconomy or of a particular industry. New built-in variables were added: strategy.max_runup -\nReturns the maximum equity run-up value for the whole trading\ninterval. syminfo.volumetype -\nReturns the volume type of the current symbol. chart.is_heikinashi -\nReturns true if the chart type is Heikin Ashi, false otherwise. chart.is_kagi -\nReturns true if the chart type is Kagi, false otherwise. chart.is_linebreak -\nReturns true if the chart type is Line break, false otherwise. chart.is_pnf -\nReturns true if the chart type is Point & figure, false otherwise. chart.is_range -\nReturns true if the chart type is Range, false otherwise. chart.is_renko -\nReturns true if the chart type is Renko, false otherwise. New matrix functions were added: matrix.new<type>() -\nCreates a new matrix object. A matrix is a two-dimensional data\nstructure containing rows and columns. All elements in the matrix\nmust be of the type specified in the type template (“<type>”). matrix.row() -\nCreates a one-dimensional array from the elements of a matrix row. matrix.col() -\nCreates a one-dimensional array from the elements of a matrix\ncolumn. matrix.get() -\nReturns the element with the specified index of the matrix. matrix.set() -\nAssigns value to the element at the column and row index of\nthe matrix. matrix.rows() -\nReturns the number of rows in the matrix. matrix.columns() -\nReturns the number of columns in the matrix. matrix.elements_count() -\nReturns the total number of matrix elements. matrix.add_row() -\nAdds a row to the matrix.

The first row\nand first column become the last, and the last become the first. matrix.reshape() -\nRebuilds the matrix to rows x cols dimensions. matrix.concat() -\nAppend one matrix to another. matrix.sum() -\nReturns a new matrix resulting from the sum of two matrices, or of a\nmatrix and a scalar (a numerical value). matrix.diff() -\nReturns a new matrix resulting from the subtraction between\nmatrices, or of matrix and a scalar (a numerical value). matrix.mult() -\nReturns a new matrix resulting from the product between the\nmatrices, or between a matrix and a scalar (a numerical value), or\nbetween a matrix and a vector (an array of values). matrix.sort() -\nRearranges the rows in the id matrix following the sorted order of\nthe values in the column . matrix.avg() -\nCalculates the average of all elements in the matrix. matrix.max() -\nReturns the largest value from the matrix elements. matrix.min() -\nReturns the smallest value from the matrix elements. matrix.median() -\nCalculates the median (“the middle” value) of matrix elements. matrix.mode() -\nCalculates the mode of the matrix, which is the most frequently\noccurring value from the matrix elements. When there are multiple\nvalues occurring equally frequently, the function returns the\nsmallest of those values. matrix.pow() -\nCalculates the product of the matrix by itself power times. matrix.det() -\nReturns the determinant of a square matrix. matrix.transpose() -\nCreates a new, transposed version of the matrix by interchanging the\nrow and column index of each element. matrix.pinv() -\nReturns the pseudoinverse of a matrix. matrix.inv() -\nReturns the inverse of a square matrix. matrix.rank() -\nCalculates the rank of the matrix. matrix.trace() -\nCalculates the trace of a matrix (the sum of the main diagonal’s\nelements). matrix.eigenvalues() -\nReturns an array containing the eigenvalues of a square matrix. matrix.eigenvectors() -\nReturns a matrix of eigenvectors, in which each column is an\neigenvector of the matrix. matrix.kron() -\nReturns the Kronecker product for the two matrices. matrix.is_zero() -\nDetermines if all elements of the matrix are zero. matrix.is_identity() -\nDetermines if a matrix is an identity matrix (elements with ones on\nthe main diagonal and zeros elsewhere). matrix.is_binary() -\nDetermines if the matrix is binary (when all elements of the matrix\nare 0 or 1). matrix.is_symmetric() -\nDetermines if a square matrix is symmetric (elements are symmetric\nwith respect to the main diagonal). matrix.is_antisymmetric() -\nDetermines if a matrix is antisymmetric (its transpose equals its\nnegative). matrix.is_diagonal() -\nDetermines if the matrix is diagonal (all elements outside the main\ndiagonal are zero). matrix.is_antidiagonal() -\nDetermines if the matrix is anti-diagonal (all elements outside the\nsecondary diagonal are zero). matrix.is_triangular() -\nDetermines if the matrix is triangular (if all elements above or\nbelow the main diagonal are zero). matrix.is_stochastic() -\nDetermines if the matrix is stochastic. matrix.is_square() -\nDetermines if the matrix is square (it has the same number of rows\nand columns). Added a new parameter for the strategy() function: risk_free_rate - The risk-free rate of return is the annual\npercentage change in the value of an investment with minimal or zero\nrisk, used to calculate the Sharpe and Sortino ratios. New array functions were added: array.sort_indices() -\nreturns an array of indices which, when used to index the original\narray, will access its elements in their sorted order. array.percentrank() -\nreturns the percentile rank of a value in the array. array.percentile_nearest_rank() -\nreturns the value for which the specified percentage of array values\n(percentile) are less than or equal to it, using the nearest-rank\nmethod. array.percentile_linear_interpolation() -\nreturns the value for which the specified percentage of array values\n(percentile) are less than or equal to it, using linear\ninterpolation. array.abs() -\nreturns an array containing the absolute value of each element in\nthe original array. array.binary_search() -\nreturns the index of the value, or -1 if the value is not found. array.binary_search_leftmost() -\nreturns the index of the value if it is found or the index of the\nnext smallest element to the left of where the value would lie if it\nwas in the array. array.binary_search_rightmost() -\nreturns the index of the value if it is found or the index of the\nelement to the right of where the value would lie if it was in the\narray. Added a new optional nth parameter for the array.min() and array.max() functions. Added index in for..in operator. It tracks the current iteration’s index. It is now possible to merge several cells in a table. A merged cell\ndoesn’t have to be a header: you can merge cells in any direction,\nas long as the resulting cell doesn’t affect any already merged\ncells and doesn’t go outside of the table’s bounds. Cells can be\nmerged with the new table.merge_cells() function. Tables now support tooltips, floating labels that appear when you\nhover over a table’s cell. To add a tooltip, pass a string to the tooltip argument of the table.cell() function or use the new table.cell_set_tooltip() function. Added templates and the ability to create arrays via templates. Instead\nof using one of the array.new_*() functions, a template function array.new<type>() can be used. In the example below, we use this functionality to create\nan array filled with float values: //@version=5\nindicator(\"array.new<float> example\")\nlength = 5\nvar a = array.new<float>(length, close)\nif array.size(a) == length array.remove(a, 0) array.push(a, close)\nplot(array.sum(a) / length, \"SMA\") New functions were added: Added new functions to clone drawings: The space between lines drawn in Pine Script can now be filled! We’ve\nadded a new linefill drawing type, along with a number of functions\ndedicated to manipulating it. Linefills are created by passing two lines\nand a color to the linefill.new() function, and their behavior is\nbased on the lines they’re tied to: they extend in the same direction\nas the lines, move when their lines move, and are deleted when one of\nthe two lines is deleted. New linefill-related functions: Added a number of new functions that provide more ways to process\nstrings, and introduce regular expressions to Pine Script: str.contains(source,\nstr) -\nDetermines if the source string contains the str substring. str.pos(source,\nstr) -\nReturns the position of the str string in the source string. str.substring(source, begin_pos,\nend_pos) -\nExtracts a substring from the source string. str.replace(source, target, replacement,\noccurrence) -\nContrary to the existing str.replace_all() function, str.replace() allows the selective replacement of a\nmatched substring with a replacement string. str.lower(source) and str.upper(source) -\nConvert all letters of the source string to lower or upper case: str.startswith(source,\nstr) and str.endswith(source,\nstr) -\nDetermine if the source string starts or ends with the str substring. str.match(source,\nregex) -\nExtracts the substring matching the specified regular\nexpression . Box drawings now supports text. The box.new() function has five new parameters for text manipulation: text , text_size , text_color , text_valign , and text_halign .\nAdditionally, five new functions to set the text properties of existing\nboxes were added: Added new built-in variables that return the bar_index and time values of the last bar in the dataset. Their values are known at the\nbeginning of the script’s calculation: New built-in source variable: hlcc4 -\nA shortcut for (high + low + close + close)/4 . It averages the\nhigh and low values with the double-weighted close. Added a new for…in operator to iterate over all elements of an array: //@version=5\nindicator(\"My Script\")\nint[] a1 = array.from(1, 3, 6, 3, 8, 0, -9, 5) highest(array) => var int highestNum = na for item in array if na(highestNum) or item > highestNum highestNum := item highestNum plot(highest(a1)) Added function overloads. Several functions in a script can now share\nthe same name, as long one of the following conditions is true: Each overload has a different number of parameters: //@version=5\nindicator(\"Function overload\") // Two parameters\nmult(x1, x2) => x1 * x2 // Three parameters\nmult(x1, x2, x3) => x1 * x2 * x3 plot(mult(7, 4))\nplot(mult(7, 4, 2)) When overloads have the same number of parameters, all parameters in\neach overload must be explicitly typified, and their type\ncombinations must be unique: //@version=5\nindicator(\"Function overload\") // Accepts both 'int' and 'float' values - any 'int' can be automatically cast to 'float'\nmult(float x1, float x2) => x1 * x2 // Returns a 'bool' value instead of a number\nmult(bool x1, bool x2) => x1 and x2 ? true : false mult(string x1, string x2) => str.tonumber(x1) * str.tonumber(x2) // Has three parameters, so explicit types are not required\nmult(x1, x2, x3) => x1 * x2 * x3 plot(mult(7, 4))\nplot(mult(7.5, 4.2))\nplot(mult(true, false) ? 1 : 0)\nplot(mult(\"5\", \"6\"))\nplot(mult(7, 4, 2)) Added a new [currency] argument to most request.*() functions. If specified, price values returned by the function will be\nconverted from the source currency to the target currency. The following\nfunctions are affected: Pine Script v5 is here! This is a list of the new features added to\nthe language, and a few of the changes made. See the Pine Script v5 Migration guide for\na complete list of the changes in v5. Libraries are a new type of publication. They allow you to create custom\nfunctions for reuse in other scripts. See this manual’s page on Libraries . Pine Script now supports switch structures! They provide a more convenient and readable alternative to\nlong ternary operators and if statements. while loops are here! They allow you to create a loop that will only stop when\nits controlling condition is false, or a break command is used in the\nloop. New built-in array variables are maintained by the Pine Script runtime\nto hold the IDs of all the active objects of the same type drawn by your\nscript. They are label.all , line.all , box.all and table.all . The runtime.error() function makes it possible to halt the execution of a script and display\na runtime error with a custom message. You can use any condition in your\nscript to trigger the call. Parameter definitions in user-defined functions can now include a\ndefault value: a function defined as f(x = 1) => x will return 1 when\ncalled as f() , i.e., without providing an argument for its x parameter. New variables and functions provide better script visibility on strategy\ninformation: A new earnings.standardized constant for the request.earnings() function allows requesting standardized earnings data. A v4 to v5 converter is now included in the Pine Script Editor. See the\nPine Script v5 Migration guide for more information on converting your scripts to v5. The Reference\nManual now\nincludes the systematic mention of the form and type (e.g., “simple\nint”) required for each function parameter. The User Manual was\nreorganized and new content was added. Many built-in variables, functions and function arguments were renamed\nor moved to new namespaces in v5. The venerable study() , for example,\nis now indicator() ,\nand security() is now request.security() .\nNew namespaces now group related functions and variables together. This\nconsolidation implements a more rational nomenclature and provides an\norderly space to accommodate the many additions planned for Pine\nScript. See the Pine Script v5 Migration guide for\na complete list of the changes made in v5. New parameter has been added for the dividends() , earnings() , financial() , quandl() , security() , and splits() functions: ignore_invalid_symbol - determines the behavior of the function if\nthe specified symbol is not found: if false , the script will halt\nand return a runtime error; if true , the function will return na and execution will continue. tostring now accepts “bool” and “string” types. New argument for time and time_close functions was added: timezone - timezone of the session argument, can only be used\nwhen a session is specified. Can be written out in GMT notation\n(e.g. “GMT-5”) or as an IANA time zone database\nname (e.g. “America/New_York”). It is now possible to place a drawing object in the future with xloc = xloc.bar_index . New argument for study and strategy functions was added: explicit_plot_zorder - specifies the order in which the\nindicator’s plots, fills, and hlines are rendered. If true, the\nplots will be drawn based on the order in which they appear in the\nindicator’s code, each newer plot being drawn above the previous\nones. New variable was added: barstate.islastconfirmedhistory - returns true if script is\nexecuting on the dataset’s last bar when market is closed, or\nscript is executing on the bar immediately preceding the real-time\nbar, if market is open. Returns false otherwise. New function was added: round_to_mintick(x) - returns the value rounded to the symbol’s\nmintick, i.e. the nearest value that can be divided by syminfo.mintick , without the remainder, with ties rounding up. Expanded tostring() functionality. The function now accepts three new\nformatting arguments: format.mintick to format to tick precision. format.volume to abbreviate large values. format.percent to format percentages. Improved backtesting functionality by adding the Leverage mechanism. Added support for table drawings and functions for working with them.\nTables are unique objects that are not anchored to specific bars; they\nfloat in a script’s space, independently of the chart bars being viewed\nor the zoom factor used. For more information, see the Tables User Manual page. New functions were added: color.rgb(red, green, blue, transp) - creates a new color with\ntransparency using the RGB color model. color.from_gradient(value, bottom_value, top_value, bottom_color, top_color) -\nreturns color calculated from the linear gradient between\nbottom_color to top_color. color.r(color) , color.g(color) , color.b(color) , color.t(color) - retrieves the value of one of the color\ncomponents. array.from() - takes a variable number of arguments with one of\nthe types: int , float , bool , string , label , line , color , box , table and returns an array of the corresponding\ntype. A new box drawing has been added to Pine Script, making it possible\nto draw rectangles on charts using the Pine Script syntax. For more\ndetails see the Pine Script reference and the Lines and boxes User Manual page. The color.new function can now accept series and input arguments, in\nwhich case, the colors will be calculated at runtime. For more\ninformation about this, see our Colors User Manual page. New math constants were added: math.pi - is a named constant for Archimedes’ constant. It is\nequal to 3.1415926535897932. math.phi - is a named constant for the golden ratio. It is equal\nto 1.6180339887498948. math.rphi - is a named constant for the golden ratio conjugate. It\nis equal to 0.6180339887498948. math.e - is a named constant for Euler’s number. It is equal to\n2.7182818284590452. New math functions were added: round(x, precision) - returns the value of x rounded to the\nnearest integer, with ties rounding up. If the precision parameter\nis used, returns a float value rounded to that number of decimal\nplaces. median(source, length) - returns the median of the series. mode(source, length) - returns the mode of the series. If there\nare several values with the same frequency, it returns the smallest\nvalue. range(source, length) - returns the difference between the min and max values in a series. todegrees(radians) - returns an approximately equivalent angle in\ndegrees from an angle measured in radians. toradians(degrees) - returns an approximately equivalent angle in\nradians from an angle measured in degrees. random(min, max, seed) - returns a pseudo-random value. The\nfunction will generate a different sequence of values for each\nscript execution. Using the same value for the optional seed\nargument will produce a repeatable sequence. New functions were added: session.ismarket - returns true if the current bar is a part of\nthe regular trading hours (i.e. market hours), false otherwise. session.ispremarket - returns true if the current bar is a part\nof the pre-market, false otherwise. session.ispostmarket - returns true if the current bar is a part\nof the post-market, false otherwise. str.format - converts the values to strings based on the specified\nformats. Accepts certain number modifiers: integer , currency , percent . New assignment operators were added: += - addition assignment -= - subtraction assignment *= - multiplication assignment /= - division assignment %= - modulus assignment New parameters for inputs customization were added: inline - combines all the input calls with the same inline value\nin one line. group - creates a header above all inputs that use the same group\nstring value. The string is also used as the header text. tooltip - adds a tooltip icon to the Inputs menu. The tooltip\nstring is shown when hovering over the tooltip icon. New argument for fill function was added: fillgaps - controls whether fills continue on gaps when one of the plot calls returns an na value. A new keyword was added: varip - is similar to the var keyword, but variables declared\nwith varip retain their values between the updates of a real-time\nbar. New functions were added: tonumber() - converts a string value into a float. time_close() - returns the UNIX timestamp of the close of the\ncurrent bar, based on the resolution and session that is passed to\nthe function. dividends() - requests dividends data for the specified symbol. earnings() - requests earnings data for the specified symbol. splits() - requests splits data for the specified symbol. New arguments for the study() function were added: resolution_gaps - fills the gaps between values fetched from\nhigher timeframes when using resolution . format.percent - formats the script output values as a percentage. New variable was added: time_tradingday - the beginning time of the trading day the\ncurrent bar belongs to. The following functions now accept a series length parameter: A new type of alerts was added - script alerts. More information can be\nfound in our Help\nCenter . New array types were added: array.new_line() array.new_label() array.new_string() New functions were added: str.length() - returns number of chars in source string. array.join() - concatenates all of the elements in the array into\na string and separates these elements with the specified separator. str.split() - splits a string at a given substring separator. New max_labels_count and max_lines_count parameters were added\nto the study and strategy functions. Now you can manage the number\nof lines and labels by setting values for these parameters from 1 to\n500. New function was added: array.range() - return the difference between the min and max\nvalues in the array. The behavior of rising() and falling() functions have changed. For\nexample, rising(close,3) is now calculated as following: close[0] > close[1] and close[1] > close[2] and close[2] > close[3] Added support for input.color to the input() function. Now you can\nprovide script users with color selection through the script’s\n“Settings/Inputs” tab with the same color widget used throughout the\nTradingView user interface. Learn more about this feature in our blog //@version=4\nstudy(\"My Script\", overlay = true)\ncolor c_labelColor = input(color.green, \"Main Color\", input.color)\nvar l = label.new(bar_index, close, yloc = yloc.abovebar, text = \"Colored label\")\nlabel.set_x(l, bar_index)\nlabel.set_color(l, c_labelColor) Added support for arrays and functions for working with them. You can\nnow use the powerful new array feature to build custom datasets. See our User Manual page on\narrays and our blog //@version=4\nstudy(\"My Script\")\na = array.new_float(0)\nfor i = 0 to 5 array.push(a, close[i] - open[i])\nplot(array.get(a, 4)) The following functions now accept a series length parameter. Learn more\nabout this feature in our blog : //@version=4\nstudy(\"My Script\", overlay = true)\nlength = input(10, \"Length\", input.integer, minval = 1, maxval = 100)\navgBar = avg(highestbars(length), lowestbars(length))\nfloat dynLen = nz(abs(avgBar) + 1, length)\ndynSma = sma(close, int(dynLen))\nplot(dynSma) Optimized script compilation time. Scripts now compile 1.5 to 2\ntimes faster. Minor bug fixes and improvements. New resolution parameter was added to the study function. Now\nyou can add MTF functionality to scripts and decide the timeframe\nyou want the indicator to run on. Please note that you need to reapply the indicator in order for the\n[resolution] parameter to appear. The tooltip argument was added to the label.new function along\nwith the label.set_tooltip function: //@version=4\nstudy(\"My Script\", overlay=true)\nvar l=label.new(bar_index, close, yloc=yloc.abovebar, text=\"Label\")\nlabel.set_x(l,bar_index)\nlabel.set_tooltip(l, \"Label Tooltip\") Added an ability to create alerts on\nstrategies . A new function line.get_price() can be used to determine the price level at which the line is\nlocated on a certain bar. New label\nstyles allow you to position the label pointer in any direction. Find and Replace was added to Pine Editor. To use this, press CTRL+F\n(find) or CTRL+H (find and replace). timezone argument was added for time functions. Now you can\nspecify timezone for second , minute , hour , year , month , dayofmonth , dayofweek functions: //@version=4\nstudy(\"My Script\")\nplot(hour(1591012800000, \"GMT+1\")) syminfo.basecurrency variable was added. Returns the base currency\ncode of the current symbol. For EURUSD symbol returns EUR. else if statement was added The behavior of security() function has changed: the expression parameter can be series or tuple. New function was added: quandl() - request quandl data for a symbol New function was added: financial() - request financial data for a symbol New functions for common indicators were added: cmo() - Chande Momentum Oscillator mfi() - Money Flow Index bb() - Bollinger Bands bbw() - Bollinger Bands Width kc() - Keltner Channels kcw() - Keltner Channels Width dmi() - DMI/ADX wpr() - Williams % R hma() - Hull Moving Average supertrend() - SuperTrend Added a detailed description of all the fields in the Strategy Tester\nReport . New Pine Script indicator VWAP Anchored was added. Now you can\nspecify the time period: Session, Month, Week, Year. Fixed a problem with calculating percentrank function. Now it can\nreturn a zero value, which did not happen before due to an incorrect\ncalculation. The default transparency parameter for the plot() , plotshape() , and plotchar() functions is now 0%. For the functions plot() , plotshape() , plotchar() , plotbar() , plotcandle() , plotarrow() , you can set the display parameter, which controls the display of the plot. The\nfollowing values can be assigned to it: display.none - the plot is not displayed display.all - the plot is displayed (Default) The textalign argument was added to the label.new function along\nwith the label.set_textalign function. Using those, you can\ncontrol the alignment of the label’s text: //@version=4\nstudy(\"My Script\", overlay = true)\nvar l = label.new(bar_index, high, text=\"Right\\n aligned\\n text\", textalign=text.align_right)\nlabel.set_xy(l, bar_index, high) .. image:: images/ReleaseNotes-Label_text_align.png New built-in variables were added: iii - Intraday Intensity Index wvad - Williams Variable Accumulation/Distribution wad - Williams Accumulation/Distribution obv - On Balance Volume pvt - Price-Volume Trend nvi - Negative Volume Index pvi - Positive Volume Index New parameters were added for strategy.close() : qty - the number of contracts/shares/lots/units to exit a trade\nwith qty_percent - defines the percentage of entered\ncontracts/shares/lots/units to exit a trade with comment - addtional notes on the order New parameter was added for strategy.close_all : comment - additional notes on the order Warning messages were added. For example, if you don’t specify exit parameters for strategy.exit - profit , limit , loss , stop or one of the\nfollowing pairs: trail_offset and trail_price / trail_points -\nyou will see a warning message in the console in the Pine Script\neditor. Increased the maximum number of arguments in max , min , avg functions. Now you can use up to ten arguments in these functions. plotchar() function now supports most of the Unicode symbols: //@version=4\nstudy(\"My Script\", overlay=true)\nplotchar(open > close, char=\"🐻\") .. image:: images/ReleaseNotes-Bears_in_plotchar.png New bordercolor argument of the plotcandle() function allows you\nto change the color of candles’ borders: //@version=4\nstudy(\"My Script\")\nplotcandle(open, high, low, close, title='Title', color = open < close ? color.green : color.red, wickcolor=color.black, bordercolor=color.orange) New variables added: syminfo.description - returns a description of the current\nsymbol syminfo.currency - returns the currency code of the current\nsymbol (EUR, USD, etc.) syminfo.type - returns the type of the current symbol (stock,\nfutures, index, etc.) New parameters to the strategy function were added: process_orders_on_close allows the broker emulator to try to\nexecute orders after calculating the strategy at the bar’s close close_entries_rule allows to define the sequence used for closing\npositions Some fixes were made: fill() function now works correctly with na as the color parameter value sign() function now calculates correctly for literals and\nconstants str.replace_all(source, target, replacement) function was added. It\nreplaces each occurrence of a target string in the source string\nwith a replacement string New variables added: timeframe.isseconds returns true when current resolution is in\nseconds timeframe.isminutes returns true when current resolution is in\nminutes time_close returns the current bar’s close time The behavior of some functions, variables and operators has changed: The time variable returns the correct open time of the bar for\nmore special cases than before An optional seconds parameter of the timestamp() function allows\nyou to set the time to within seconds security() function: Added the possibility of requesting resolutions in seconds: 1, 5, 15, 30 seconds (chart resolution should be less than or\nequal to the requested resolution) Reduced the maximum value that can be requested in some of the\nother resolutions: from 1 to 1440 minutes from 1 to 365 days from 1 to 52 weeks from 1 to 12 months Changes to the evaluation of ternary operator branches: In Pine Script v3, during the execution of a ternary operator, both\nits branches are calculated, so when this script is added to the\nchart, a long position is opened, even if the long() function is not\ncalled: //@version=3\nstrategy(title = \"My Strategy\")\nlong() => strategy.entry(\"long\", true, 1, when = open > high[1]) 1\nc = 0\nc := true ? 1 : long()\nplot(c) Pine Script v4 contains built-in functions with side effects ( ``line.new`` and ``label.new`` ). If calls to these functions are present in both branches of a ternary operator, both function calls would be executed following v3 conventions. Thus, in Pine Script v4, only the branch corresponding to the evaluated condition is calculated. While this provides a viable solution in some cases, it will modify the behavior of scripts which depended on the fact that both branches of a ternary were evaluated. The solution is to pre-evaluate expressions prior to the ternary operator. The conversion utility takes this requirement into account when converting scripts from v3 to v4, so that script behavior will be identical in v3 and v4. Support for drawing objects. Added label and line drawings var keyword for one time variable initialization Type system improvements: series string data type functions for explicit type casting syntax for explicit variable type declaration new input type forms Renaming of built-ins and a version 3 to 4 converter utility max_bars_back function to control series variables internal\nhistory buffer sizes Pine Script documentation versioning To increase the number of indicators available to the whole\ncommunity, Invite-Only scripts can now be published by Premium users\nonly. Improved the Strategy Tester by reworking the Maximum Drawdown\ncalculation formula. With the new argument show_last in the plot-type functions, you\ncan restrict the number of bars that the plot is displayed on. A major script publishing improvement: it is now possible to update\nyour script without publishing a new one via the Update button in\nthe publishing dialog. Expanded the type system by adding a new type of constants that can\nbe calculated during compilation. Expanded the keyword argument functionality: it is now possible to\nuse keyword arguments in all built-in functions. A new barstate.isconfirmed variable has been added to the list of\nvariables that return bar status. It lets you create indicators that\nare calculated based on the closed bars only. The options argument for the input() function creates an input\nwith a set of options defined by the script’s author. Pine Script v3 is here! Some important changes: Changes to the default behavior of the security() function: it\ncan no longer access the future data by default. This can be\nchanges with the lookahead parameter. An implicit conversion of boolean values to numeric values was\nreplaced with an implicit conversion of numeric values (integer\nand float) to boolean values. Self-referenced and forward-referenced variables were removed.\nAny PineScript code that used those language constructions can\nbe equivalently rewritten using mutable variables. Several improvements to the strategy tester and the strategy report: New Buy & Hold equity graph — a new graph that lets you compare\nperformance of your strategy versus a “buy and hold”, i.e if\nyou just bought a security and held onto it without trading. Added percentage values to the absolute currency values. Added Buy & Hold Return to display the final value of Buy & Hold\nEquity based on last price. Added Sharpe Ratio — it shows the relative effectiveness of the\ninvestment portfolio (security), a measure that indicates the\naverage return minus the risk-free return divided by the\nstandard deviation of return on an investment. Slippage lets you simulate a situation when orders are filled at\na worse price than expected. It can be set through the\nProperties dialog or through the slippage argument in the strategy() function. Commission allows yot to add commission for placed orders in\npercent of order value, fixed price or per contract. The amount\nof commission paid is shown in the Commission Paid field. The\ncommission size and its type can be set through the Properties\ndialog or through the commission_type and commission_value\narguments in the strategy() function. Added invite-only scripts. The invite-only indicators are visible in\nthe Community Scripts, but nobody can use them without explicit\npermission from the author, and only the author can see the source\ncode. Introduded indicator revisions. Each time an indicator is saved, it\ngets a new revision, and it is possible to easily switch to any past\nrevision from the Pine Editor. It is now possible to publish indicators with protected source code.\nThese indicators are available in the public Script Library, and any\nuser can use them, but only the author can see the source code. Improved the behavior of the fill() function: one call can now\nsupport several different colors. Color type variables now have an additional parameter to set default\ntransparency. The transparency can be set with the color.new() function, or by adding an alpha-channel value to a hex color code. Added for loops and keywords break and continue . Pine Script now supports mutable variables! Use the := operator\nto assign a new value to a variable that has already been defined. Multiple improvements and bug fixes for strategies. A new alertcondition() function allows for creating custom alert\nconditions in Pine Script-based indicators. Pine has graduated to v2! The new version of Pine Script added\nsupport for if statements, making it easier to write more readable\nand concise code. Added backtesting functionality to Pine Script. It is now possible\nto create trading strategies, i.e. scripts that can send, modify and\ncancel orders to buy or sell. Strategies allow you to perform\nbacktesting (emulation of strategy trading on historical data) and\nforward testing (emulation of strategy trading on real-time data)\naccording to your algorithms. Detailed information about the\nstrategy’s calculations and the order fills can be seen in the\nnewly added Strategy Tester tab. A new editable parameter allows hiding the plot from the Style\nmenu in the indicator settings so that it is not possible to edit\nits style. The parameter has been added to all the following\nfunctions: all plot-type functions, barcolor() , bgcolor() , hline() , and fill() . Added two new functions to display custom barsets using PineScipt: plotbar() and plotcandle() . Added two new shapes to the plotshape() function: shape.labelup\nand shape.labeldown. PineScipt Editor has been improved and moved to a new panel at the\nbottom of the page. Added a new step argument for the input() function, allowing to\nspecify the step size for the indicator’s inputs. Added support for inputs with the source type to the input() function, allowing to select the data source for the indicator’s\ncalculations from its settings. Added a new text argument to plotshape() and plotchar() functions. Added four new shapes to the plotshape() function: shape.arrowup,\nshape.arrowdown, shape.square, shape.diamond. Improved the script sharing capabilities, changed the layout of the\nIndicators menu and separated published scripts from ideas. Added three new plotting functions, plotshape() , plotchar() , and plotarrow() for situations when you need to highlight specific\nbars on a chart without drawing a line. Integrated QUANDL data into Pine Script. The data can be accessed\nby passing the QUANDL ticker to the security function. Added Pine Script sharing, enabling programmers and traders to\nshare their scripts with the rest of the TradingView community. Added support for inputs, allowing users to edit the indicator\ninputs through the properties window, without needing to edit the\nPine script. Added self-referencing variables. Added support for multiline functions. Implemented the type-casting mechanism, automatically casting\nconstant and simple float and int values to series when it is\nrequired. Added several new functions and improved the existing ones: barssince() and valuewhen() allow you to check conditions on\nhistorical data easier. The new barcolor() function lets you specify a color for a bar\nbased on filling of a certain condition. Similar to the barcolor() function, the bgcolor() function\nchanges the color of the background. Reworked the security() function, further expanding its\nfunctionality. Improved the fill() function, enabling it to be used more than\nonce in one script. Added the round() function to round and convert float values\nto integers. The first version of Pine Script is introduced to all TradingView\nusers, initially as an open beta, on December 13th."}]}

Welcome also to the very active community\nof Pine Script programmers on TradingView. On this page, we present a step-by-step approach that you can follow to gradually become more familiar with indicators and strategies (also called scripts ) written in the Pine Script programming language on TradingView . We will get you started on your journey to: Use some of the tens of thousands of existing scripts on the\nplatform. Read the Pine Script code of existing scripts. Write Pine scripts. If you are already familiar with the use of Pine scripts on TradingView and are now ready to learn how to write your own, then jump to the Writing scripts section of this page. If you are new to our platform, then please read on! If you are interested in using technical indicators or strategies on\nTradingView, you can first start exploring the thousands of indicators\nalready available on our platform. You can access existing indicators on\nthe platform in two different ways: By using the chart’s “Indicators, metrics, and strategies” button. By browsing TradingView’s Community scripts , the largest repository of trading scripts in the world, with more than 150,000 scripts, half of which are free and open-source , which means you can see their Pine Script code. If you can find the tools you need already written for you, it can be a\ngood way to get started and gradually become proficient as a script\nuser, until you are ready to start your programming journey in Pine\nScript. To explore and load scripts from your chart, click the “Indicators, metrics, and strategies” button, or use the forward slash / keyboard shortcut: The dialog box that appears presents different categories of scripts in its left pane: “Favorites” lists the scripts you have “favorited” by clicking on the star that appears to the left of the script name when you hover over it. “Personal” displays the scripts you have written and saved in the Pine Editor. They are saved on TradingView’s servers. “Technicals” groups most TradingView built-in scripts, organized in four categories: “Indicators”, “Strategies”, “Profiles”, and “Patterns”. Most are written in Pine Script and available for free. “Financials” contains all built-in indicators that display financial metrics. The contents of that tab and the subcategories they are grouped into depend on the symbol currently open on the chart. “Community” is where you can search from the more than 150,000 published scripts written by TradingView users. The scripts can be sorted by one of the three different filters — “Editors’ picks” only shows open-source scripts hand-picked by our script moderators, “Top” shows the most popular scripts of all time, and “Trending” displays the most popular scripts that were published recently. “Invite-only” contains the list of the invite-only scripts you have been granted access to by their authors. Here, we selected the “Technicals” tab to see the TradingView built-in indicators: Clicking on one of the listed indicators or strategies loads the script on your chart. Strategy scripts are distinguished from indicators by a special symbol that appears to the right of the script name. To access the Community scripts feed from TradingView’s homepage , select “Indicators and strategies” from the “Community” menu: You can also search for scripts using the homepage’s “Search” field, and filter scripts using different criteria. See this Help Center page explaining the different types of scripts that are available. The scripts feed generates script widgets , which show the title and author of each publication with a preview of the published chart and description. Clicking on a widget opens the script page , which shows the publication’s complete description, an enlarged chart, and any additional release notes. Users can boost, favorite, share, and comment on publications. If it is an open-source script, the source code is also available on the script page. When you find an interesting script in the Community scripts, follow the instructions in the Help Center to load it on your chart . Once a script is loaded on the chart, you can double-click on its name or hover over the name and press the “Settings” button to bring up its “Settings/Inputs” tab: The “Inputs” tab allows you to change the settings which the script’s\nauthor has decided to make editable. You can configure some of the\nscript’s visuals using the “Style” tab of the same dialog box, and\nwhich timeframes the script should appear on using the “Visibility”\ntab. Other settings are available to all scripts from the buttons that appear\nto the right of its name when you mouse over it, and from the “More”\nmenu (the three dots): Reading code written by good programmers is the best way to develop\nyour understanding of the language. This is as true for Pine Script as\nit is for all other programming languages. Finding good open-source Pine\nScript code is relatively easy. These are reliable sources of code\nwritten by good programmers on TradingView: Reading code from Community scripts is easy; if there is no grey or red “lock” icon in the upper-right corner of the script widget, then the script is open-source. By opening the script page, you can read its full source code. To see the code of a TradingView built-in indicator, load the indicator on your chart, then hover over its name and select the “Source code” curly braces icon (if you don’t see it, it’s because the indicator’s source is unavailable). When you click on the {} icon, the Pine Editor opens below the chart and displays the script’s code. If you want to edit the script, you must first select the “Create a working copy” button. You will then be able to modify and save the code. Because the working copy is a different version of the script, you need to use the Editor’s “Add to chart” button to add that new copy to the chart. For example, this image shows the Pine Editor, where we selected to view the source code from the “Bollinger Bands” indicator on our chart. Initially, the script is read-only , as indicated by the orange warning text: You can also open editable versions of the TradingView built-in scripts from the Pine Editor by using the “Create new” > “Built-in…” menu selection: We have built Pine Script to empower both new and experienced traders to create their own trading tools. Although learning a first programming language, like trading, is rarely very easy for anyone, we have designed Pine Script so it is relatively easy to learn for first-time programmers, yet powerful enough for knowledgeable programmers to build tools of moderate complexity. Pine Script allows you to write three types of scripts: Indicators , like RSI, MACD, etc. Strategies , which include logic to issue trading orders and can be backtested and forward-tested. Libraries , which are used by more advanced programmers to package often-used functions that can be reused by other scripts. The next step we recommend is to write your first indicator ."}]}

Because close built-in variable is\nalways a value that corresponds to a visible bar (or candle) on the\nchart. So, how do we get the real OHLC prices in Pine Script® code, if current\nchart type is non-standard? We should use request.security function in\ncombination with ticker.new function. Here is an example: //@version=6\nindicator(\"Real OHLC\", overlay = true)\nt = ticker.new(syminfo.prefix, syminfo.ticker)\nrealC = request.security(t, timeframe.period, close)\nplot(realC) In a similar way we may get other OHLC prices: open , high and low . Backtesting on non-standard chart types (e.g. Heikin Ashi or Renko) is\nnot recommended because the bars on these kinds of charts do not\nrepresent real price movement that you would encounter while trading. If\nyou want your strategy to enter and exit on real prices but still use\nHeikin Ashi-based signals, you can use the same method to get Heikin\nAshi values on a regular candlestick chart: //@version=6\nstrategy(\"BarUpDn Strategy\", overlay = true, default_qty_type = strategy.percent_of_equity, default_qty_value = 10)\nmaxIdLossPcntInput = input.float(1, \"Max Intraday Loss(%)\")\nstrategy.risk.max_intraday_loss(maxIdLossPcntInput, strategy.percent_of_equity)\nneedTrade() => close > open and open > close[1] ? 1 : close < open and open < close[1] ? -1 : 0\ntrade = request.security(ticker.heikinashi(syminfo.tickerid), timeframe.period, needTrade())\nif trade == 1 strategy.entry(\"BarUp\", strategy.long)\nif trade == -1 strategy.entry(\"BarDn\", strategy.short) You may use plotshape with style shape.arrowup and shape.arrowdown : //@version=6\nindicator('Ex 1', overlay = true)\ncondition = close >= open\nplotshape(condition, color = color.lime, style = shape.arrowup, text = \"Buy\")\nplotshape(not condition, color = color.red, style = shape.arrowdown, text = \"Sell\") You may use the plotchar function with any unicode character: //@version=6\nindicator('buy/sell arrows', overlay = true)\ncondition = close >= open\nplotchar(not condition, char='↓', color = color.lime, text = \"Buy\")\nplotchar(condition, char='↑', location = location.belowbar, color = color.red, text = \"Sell\") There is the function hline in Pine Script, but it is limited to only\nplot a constant value.

Understanding all three is key to making the most of the\npower of Pine Script. The execution model determines how your script is executed on charts,\nand thus how the code you write in scripts works. Your code would do\nnothing were it not for Pine Script’s runtime, which kicks in after\nyour code has compiled and it is executed on your chart because one of\nthe events triggering the execution of a script has occurred. When a Pine script is loaded on a chart it executes once on each\nhistorical bar using the available OHLCV (open, high, low, close,\nvolume) values for each bar. Once the script’s execution reaches the\nrightmost bar in the dataset, if trading is currently active on the\nchart’s symbol, then Pine Script indicators will execute once every\ntime an update occurs, i.e., price or volume changes. Pine Script strategies will by default only execute when the rightmost bar closes,\nbut they can also be configured to execute on every update, like\nindicators do. All symbol/timeframe pairs have a dataset comprising a limited number of\nbars. When you scroll a chart to the left to see the dataset’s earlier\nbars, the corresponding bars are loaded on the chart. The loading\nprocess stops when there are no more bars for that particular\nsymbol/timeframe pair or the maximum number of\nbars your account type permits has been loaded. You can scroll the chart to\nthe left until the very first bar of the dataset, which has an index\nvalue of 0 (see bar_index ). When the script first runs on a chart, all bars in a dataset are historical bars , except the rightmost one if a trading session is\nactive. When trading is active on the rightmost bar, it is called the realtime bar . The realtime bar updates when a price or volume change\nis detected. When the realtime bar closes, it becomes an elapsed\nrealtime bar and a new realtime bar opens. Let’s take a simple script and follow its execution on historical bars: //@version=6\nindicator(\"My Script\", overlay = true)\nsrc = close\na = ta.sma(src, 5)\nb = ta.sma(src, 50)\nc = ta.cross(a, b)\nplot(a, color = color.blue)\nplot(b, color = color.black)\nplotshape(c, color = color.red) On historical bars, a script executes at the equivalent of the bar’s\nclose, when the OHLCV values are all known for that bar. Prior to\nexecution of the script on a bar, the built-in variables such as open , high , low , close , volume and time are set to values\ncorresponding to those from that bar. A script executes once per\nhistorical bar . Our example script is first executed on the very first bar of the\ndataset at index 0. Each statement is executed using the values for the\ncurrent bar. Accordingly, on the first bar of the dataset, the following\nstatement: src = close initializes the variable src with the close value for that first\nbar, and each of the next lines is executed in turn. Because the script\nonly executes once for each historical bar, the script will always\ncalculate using the same close value for a specific historical bar. The execution of each line in the script produces calculations which in\nturn generate the indicator’s output values, which can then be plotted\non the chart. Our example uses the plot and plotshape calls at the\nend of the script to output some values. In the case of a strategy, the\noutcome of the calculations can be used to plot values or dictate the\norders to be placed. After execution and plotting on the first bar, the script is executed on\nthe dataset’s second bar, which has an index of 1. The process then\nrepeats until all historical bars in the dataset are processed and the\nscript reaches the rightmost bar on the chart. The behavior of a Pine script on the realtime bar is very different than\non historical bars. Recall that the realtime bar is the rightmost bar on\nthe chart when trading is active on the chart’s symbol. Also, recall\nthat strategies can behave in two different ways in the realtime bar. By\ndefault, they only execute when the realtime bar closes, but the calc_on_every_tick parameter of the strategy declaration statement\ncan be set to true to modify the strategy’s behavior so that it\nexecutes each time the realtime bar updates, as indicators do. The\nbehavior described here for indicators will thus only apply to\nstrategies using calc_on_every_tick=true . The most important difference between execution of scripts on historical\nand realtime bars is that while they execute only once on historical\nbars, scripts execute every time an update occurs during a realtime bar.\nThis entails that built-in variables such as high , low and close which never change on a historical bar, can change at each of a\nscript’s iteration in the realtime bar. Changes in the built-in\nvariables used in the script’s calculations will, in turn, induce\nchanges in the results of those calculations. This is required for the\nscript to follow the realtime price action. As a result, the same script\nmay produce different results every time it executes during the realtime\nbar. Note: In the realtime bar, the close variable always represents\nthe current price . Similarly, the high and low built-in\nvariables represent the highest high and lowest low reached since the\nrealtime bar’s beginning. Pine Script’s built-in variables will only\nrepresent the realtime bar’s final values on the bar’s last update. Let’s follow our script example in the realtime bar. When the script arrives on the realtime bar it executes a first time. It\nuses the current values of the built-in variables to produce a set of\nresults and plots them if required. Before the script executes another\ntime when the next update happens, its user-defined variables are reset\nto a known state corresponding to that of the last commit at the close\nof the previous bar. If no commit was made on the variables because they\nare initialized every bar, then they are reinitialized. In both cases\ntheir last calculated state is lost. The state of plotted labels and\nlines is also reset. This resetting of the script’s user-defined\nvariables and drawings prior to each new iteration of the script in the\nrealtime bar is called rollback . Its effect is to reset the script to\nthe same known state it was in when the realtime bar opened, so\ncalculations in the realtime bar are always performed from a clean\nstate. The constant recalculation of a script’s values as price or volume\nchanges in the realtime bar can lead to a situation where variable c in our example becomes true because a cross has occurred, and so the red\nmarker plotted by the script’s last line would appear on the chart. If\non the next price update the price has moved in such a way that the close value no longer produces calculations making c true because\nthere is no longer a cross, then the marker previously plotted will\ndisappear. When the realtime bar closes, the script executes a last time. As usual,\nvariables are rolled back prior to execution. However, since this\niteration is the last one on the realtime bar, variables are committed\nto their final values for the bar when calculations are completed. To summarize the realtime bar process: A script executes at the open of the realtime bar and then once per update . Variables are rolled back before every realtime update . Variables are committed once at the closing bar update . A script executes across all available bars in a dataset when one of the following conditions occurs: The user adds the script to their chart from the Pine Editor or the “Indicators, Metrics & Strategies” menu. The user saves a new version of the source code while the script is on the chart. The chart uses a new timeframe . The chart uses a dataset with a new ticker identifier . Several user actions affect a chart’s ticker ID, such as selecting a symbol from the “Symbol search” menu, switching between standard and non-standard chart types, activating Bar Replay mode, and toggling data modifications from the chart’s settings. The user changes any input available in the script’s “Settings/Inputs” tab. The user updates a strategy property from the “Settings/Properties” tab. The script uses the chart.left_visible_bar_time or chart.right_visible_bar_time variable in its calculations or logic, and the user changes the variable’s value by scrolling or zooming on the chart. The system detects a browser refresh event. The user opens or closes the Pine Logs pane. The user activates or deactivates the Pine Profiler . Either of the following triggers script executions on a realtime bar while the chart symbol’s session is active: One of the conditions above occurs, causing the script to execute across the entire dataset up to the latest bar. The realtime bar’s values change after new price or volume data becomes available. The script performs a new execution on that bar to use the latest information in its calculations. Note that when a chart is left untouched when the market is active, a\nsuccession of realtime bars which have been opened and then closed will\ntrail the current realtime bar. While these elapsed realtime bars will\nhave been confirmed because their variables have all been committed,\nthe script will not yet have executed on them in their historical state, since they did not exist when the script was last run on the\nchart’s dataset. When an event triggers the execution of the script on the chart and\ncauses it to run on those bars which have now become historical bars,\nthe script’s calculation can sometimes vary from what they were when\ncalculated on the last closing update of the same bars when they were\nrealtime bars. This can be caused by slight variations between the OHLCV\nvalues saved at the close of realtime bars and those fetched from data\nfeeds when the same bars have become historical bars. This behavior is\none of the possible causes of repainting . The built-in barstate.* variables provide information on the type of bar or the event where the script is executing. The page where they are\ndocumented also contains a script that allows you to visualize the\ndifference between elapsed realtime and historical bars, for\nexample. The Strategies page\nexplains the details of strategy calculations, which are not\nidentical to those of indicators. Every function call in Pine leaves a trail of historical values that a\nscript can access on subsequent bars using the [] operator. The historical series of functions depend on successive calls\nto record the output on every bar. When a script does not call functions\non each bar, it can produce an inconsistent history that may impact\ncalculations and results, namely when it depends on the continuity of\ntheir historical series to operate as expected. The compiler warns users\nin these cases to make them aware that the values from a function,\nwhether built-in or user-defined, might be misleading. To demonstrate, let’s write a script that calculates the index of the\ncurrent bar and outputs that value on every second bar. In the following\nscript, we’ve defined a calcBarIndex() function that adds 1 to the\nprevious value of its internal index variable on every bar. The script\ncalls the function on each bar that the condition returns true on\n(every other bar) to update the customIndex value. It plots this value\nalongside the built-in bar_index to validate the output: //@version=6\nindicator(\"My script\") //@function Calculates the index of the current bar by adding 1 to its own value from the previous bar.\n// The first bar will have an index of 0.\ncalcBarIndex() => int index = na index := nz(index[1], replacement = -1) + 1 //@variable Returns `true` on every other bar.\ncondition = bar_index % 2 == 0 int customIndex = na // Call `calcBarIndex()` when the `condition` is `true`. This prompts the compiler to raise a warning.\nif condition customIndex := calcBarIndex() plot(bar_index, \"Bar index\", color = color.green)\nplot(customIndex, \"Custom index\", color = color.red, style = plot.style_cross) Note that: The nz() function replaces na values with a specified replacement value (0 by default). On the\nfirst bar of the script, when the index series has no history, the na value is replaced with -1 before adding 1 to return an initial value\nof 0. Upon inspecting the chart, we see that the two plots differ wildly. The\nreason for this behavior is that the script called calcBarIndex() within the scope of an if structure on every other bar, resulting in a historical output\ninconsistent with the bar_index series. When calling the function once\nevery two bars, internally referencing the previous value of index gets the value from two bars ago, i.e., the last bar the function\nexecuted on. This behavior results in a customIndex value of half that\nof the built-in bar_index . To align the calcBarIndex() output with the bar_index , we can move\nthe function call to the script’s global scope. That way, the function\nwill execute on every bar, allowing its entire history to be recorded\nand referenced rather than only the results from every other bar. In the\ncode below, we’ve defined a globalScopeBarIndex variable in the\nglobal scope and assigned it to the return from calcBarIndex() rather\nthan calling the function locally. The script sets the customIndex to\nthe value of globalScopeBarIndex on the occurrence of the condition : //@version=6\nindicator(\"My script\") //@function Calculates the index of the current bar by adding 1 to its own value from the previous bar.\n// The first bar will have an index of 0.\ncalcBarIndex() => int index = na index := nz(index[1], replacement = -1) + 1 //@variable Returns `true` on every second bar.\ncondition = bar_index % 2 == 0 globalScopeBarIndex = calcBarIndex()\nint customIndex = na // Assign `customIndex` to `globalScopeBarIndex` when the `condition` is `true`. This won't produce a warning.\nif condition customIndex := globalScopeBarIndex plot(bar_index, \"Bar index\", color = color.green)\nplot(customIndex, \"Custom index\", color = color.red, style = plot.style_cross) This behavior can also radically impact built-in functions that\nreference history internally. For example, the ta.sma() function references its past values “under the hood”. If a script\ncalls this function conditionally rather than on every bar, the values\nwithin the calculation can change significantly. We can ensure\ncalculation consistency by assigning ta.sma() to a variable in the global scope and referencing that variable’s\nhistory as needed. The following example calculates three SMA series: controlSMA , localSMA , and globalSMA . The script calculates controlSMA in the\nglobal scope and localSMA within the local scope of an if structure. Within the if structure, it also updates the value of globalSMA using the controlSMA value. As we can see, the values from the globalSMA and controlSMA series align, whereas the localSMA series diverges from\nthe other two because it uses an incomplete history, which affects its\ncalculations: //@version=6\nindicator(\"My script\") //@variable Returns `true` on every second bar.\ncondition = bar_index % 2 == 0 controlSMA = ta.sma(close, 20)\nfloat globalSMA = na\nfloat localSMA = na // Update `globalSMA` and `localSMA` when `condition` is `true`.\nif condition globalSMA := controlSMA // No warning. localSMA := ta.sma(close, 20) // Raises warning. This function depends on its history to work as intended. plot(controlSMA, \"Control SMA\", color = color.green)\nplot(globalSMA, \"Global SMA\", color = color.blue, style = plot.style_cross)\nplot(localSMA, \"Local SMA\", color = color.red, style = plot.style_cross) This behavior is required because forcing the execution of functions on\neach bar would lead to unexpected results in those functions that\nproduce side effects, i.e., the ones that do something aside from\nreturning the value. For example, the label.new() function creates a label on the chart, so forcing it to be called on\nevery bar even when it is inside of an if structure would create labels where they should not logically appear. Not all built-in functions use their previous values in their\ncalculations, meaning not all require execution on every bar. For\nexample, math.max() compares all arguments passed into it to return the highest value. Such\nfunctions that do not interact with their history in any way do not\nrequire special treatment. If the usage of a function within a conditional block does not cause a\ncompiler warning, it’s safe to use without impacting calculations.\nOtherwise, move the function call to the global scope to force\nconsistent execution. When keeping a function call within a conditional\nblock despite the warning, ensure the output is correct at the very\nleast to avoid unexpected results."}]}

We’ve added ability to export constants from libraries. Now you can use export declaration with the ‘const int’, ‘const float’, ‘const bool’, ‘const color’, or ‘const string’ type, e.g: export const float my_pi = 3.15 The time_close variable and the time_close() function have improved behavior on tick charts and price-based charts ( Renko , line break , Kagi , point & figure , and range ). On chart types that are not time-based, the closing time of the open realtime bar is knowable only after the bar closes. Therefore, the value of time_close and time_close() is always na for that bar. Previously, it was impossible to use expressions such as time_close[1] or time_close(\"\", 1) to retrieve the closing timestamp of an elapsed realtime bar on these chart types. These expressions always returned na when they referenced a realtime bar, because the bar’s timestamp was not saved after the closing tick. With this new update, the closing timestamp of a realtime bar on tick charts or price-based charts is always available immediately after the bar closes. Now, scripts can use time_close with the [] history-referencing operator or call time_close() with a positive bars_back argument to retrieve the closing times of elapsed realtime bars on any chart type. For example: //@version=6 indicator(\"Previous closing time\") // Plot the `time_close[1]` value, representing the UNIX timestamp of the past bar's closing time. // This plot used to show `na` on all realtime bars of tick charts and price-based charts. plot(time_close[1], \"Previous bar's closing timestamp\") The style parameter of the ticker.renko() , ticker.pointfigure() , and ticker.kagi() functions accepts a new argument for box sizing: \"PercentageLTP\" . When a call to these functions uses this style argument, the returned ticker ID refers to a non-standard chart dataset with box sizes based on a user-defined percentage of the last trading price. We’ve added a setter function for boxes: box.set_xloc() . It is similar to the *.set_xloc() functions for lines and labels. The function sets the left and right coordinates of the box borders, and defines whether their values represent bar indices or UNIX timestamps. The for loop structure has updated boundary-checking behavior. Previously, any for statement established the loop counter’s end boundary ( to_num ) before starting the first iteration, and the final possible counter value could not change during the loop’s execution. Changing the result of an expression used as a for loop’s to_num argument inside the local scope did not affect the loop’s iteration range. Now, a for loop evaluates the to_num boundary dynamically , before every iteration . With this update, the loop statement can modify its stopping condition after any change to the to_num argument’s result across iterations. To learn more about this new behavior, refer to the `for` loops section of the Loops page and the Dynamic `for` loop boundaries section of the v6 migration guide . We’ve removed the scope count limit. Previously, any script’s total number of scopes, including the global scope and all local scopes from user-defined functions and methods , loops , conditional structures , user-defined types , and enums , was limited to 550. Now, scripts can contain an indefinite number of local scopes from these structures. We’ve introduced two new built-in variables, bid and ask , providing access to real-time market prices: bid - represents the highest price an active buyer is willing to pay for the instrument at its current value. ask - represents the lowest price an active seller will accept for the instrument at its current value. These variables are only available on the \"1T\" timeframe. On other timeframes, their values are na . The strategy.exit() function has updated calculation behaviors. Previously, calls to this command with arguments for the absolute and relative parameters defining a price level for the same exit order always prioritized the absolute parameter and ignored the relative one. For example, a call with specified limit and profit values always ignored the profit value. Now, the command evaluates both related parameters and uses the level that the market price is expected to activate first . See this section of the v6 migration guide for more information. Pine Script has graduated to v6! Starting today, future Pine updates will apply exclusively to this version. Therefore, we recommend converting existing v5 scripts to access new features as we roll them out. See our migration guide to understand the changes to existing Pine behaviors and learn how to convert scripts to v6. Several new features and behaviors come with this version’s release: Scripts can now call request.*() functions with “series string” arguments for the parameters that define the requested context, meaning a single request.*() call can change its requested data feed on any historical bar. Additionally, it is now possible to call request.*() functions inside the local scopes of loops , conditional structures , and exported library functions. See the Dynamic requests section of the Other timeframes and data page to learn more. Values of the “bool” type are now strictly true or false . They are never na in v6. Additionally, the or and and operators now feature short-circuit (“lazy”) evaluation. If the first expression of an or operation is true , or the first expression of an and operation is false , the script does not evaluate the second expression because it is not necessary to determine the result. These improvements help boost the runtime efficiency of scripts that rely on “bool” values and conditional expressions. The size property of labels and the text_size property of boxes and tables now support “int” values in addition to the size.* constants. These “int” values represent sizes in typographic points , offering a more granular and wide range of text size possibilities. The new text_formatting parameter of the label.new() , box.new() , and table.cell() functions determines whether the object’s displayed text is bold , italicized , or both . It accepts one of these three new text.* constants: text.format_bold , text.format_italic , text.format_none . To modify a drawing object’s text_formatting property, use the corresponding *set_text_formatting() functions. Strategies no longer stop calculating and raise an error when they reach the 9000 trade limit while not using Deep Backtesting mode. Instead, they trim the oldest orders to make space for new ones. The trimmed orders are not visible in the Strategy Tester , but that does not change the strategy’s simulation. To retrieve the trade index of the earliest non-trimmed order, use the strategy.closedtrades.first_index variable. The array.get() , array.set() , array.insert() , and array.remove() functions now support negative index arguments to reference elements starting from the end of an array . For instance, the call array.get(myArray, -2) retrieves the second to last element in myArray , which is equivalent to array.get(myArray, array.size(myArray) - 2) . The new syminfo.mincontract variable holds a value representing the smallest number of contracts/shares/lots/units required to trade the current symbol, as set by the exchange. Two new variables, syminfo.main_tickerid and timeframe.main_period , reference the ticker ID and timeframe from the script’s main context , even if the script uses them in the expression argument of a request.*() call. Here, “main context” refers to the current chart’s symbol and timeframe, unless the script is an indicator() that includes symbol or timeframe arguments in its declaration statement. We’ve added an optional behind_chart parameter to the indicator() and strategy() functions. This parameter specifies where plots and drawings appear relative to the main chart display when the overlay parameter is true . If behind_chart is true , the script’s visuals appear behind the chart display. If false , they appear in front of the chart display. The default is true . The ticker.new() and ticker.modify() functions feature two new parameters: settlement_as_close and backadjustment . Users can specify whether these parameters are on, off, or set to inherit the symbol’s default settings. These settings only affect the data from futures symbols with these options available on their charts. They have no effect on other symbols. The Sharpe and Sortino ratios in the Strategy Tester module have updated calculations. Previously, the ratios used strategy returns over monthly periods if the trading range was three or more months and daily periods if the range was three or more days but less than three months. Both ratios now always use monthly periods for consistency. We’ve added a new parameter to the box.new() , label.new() , line.new() , polyline.new() , and table.new() functions: force_overlay - If true, the drawing will display on the main chart pane, even when the script occupies a separate pane. Optional. The default is false. Enums, also known as enumerations , enumerated types , or enum types , are unique data types with all possible values declared by the programmer. They can help programmers maintain more strict control over the values allowed by variables, conditional expressions, and collections , and they enable convenient dropdown input creation with the new input.enum() function. See our User Manual’s Enums page to learn more about these new types and how to use them. We’ve added an optional calc_bars_count parameter to the indicator() , strategy() , request.security() , request.security_lower_tf() , and request.seed() functions that allows users to limit the number of recent historical bars a script or data request can execute across. When a script’s indicator() or strategy() declaration statement includes a calc_bars_count argument, its “Settings/Inputs” tab will include a “Calculated bars” input in the “Calculation” section. The default value in all these functions is 0, which signifies that the script or request executes across all the available data. The strategy.* namespace features several new built-in variables: strategy.avg_trade -\nReturns the average amount of money gained or lost per trade.\nCalculated as the sum of all profits and losses divided by the\nnumber of closed trades. strategy.avg_trade_percent -\nReturns the average percentage gain or loss per trade. Calculated as\nthe sum of all profit and loss percentages divided by the number of\nclosed trades. strategy.avg_winning_trade -\nReturns the average amount of money gained per winning trade.\nCalculated as the sum of profits divided by the number of winning\ntrades. strategy.avg_winning_trade_percent -\nReturns the average percentage gain per winning trade. Calculated as\nthe sum of profit percentages divided by the number of winning\ntrades. strategy.avg_losing_trade -\nReturns the average amount of money lost per losing trade.\nCalculated as the sum of losses divided by the number of losing\ntrades. strategy.avg_losing_trade_percent -\nReturns the average percentage loss per losing trade. Calculated as\nthe sum of loss percentages divided by the number of losing trades. Our new Pine Profiler is a powerful utility that analyzes the executions of all\nsignificant code in a script and displays helpful performance\ninformation next to the code lines inside the Pine Editor. The Profiler ’s information provides insight into a script’s runtime,\nthe distribution of runtime across significant code regions, and the\nnumber of times each code region executes. With these insights,\nprogrammers can effectively pinpoint performance bottlenecks and\nensure they focus on optimizing their code where it truly matters when they need to improve\nexecution times. See the new Profiling and optimization page to learn more about the Profiler, how it works, and how\nto use it to analyze a script’s performance and identify optimization\nopportunities. When opening the detached Pine Editor from a tab with a chart, it now\nlinks directly to that tab, as indicated by the “Linked” status and\ngreen icon in the bottom-right corner. While linked, the “Add to\nchart”, “Update on chart”, and “Apply to entire layout” buttons\naffect the charts on the main tab. The detached Pine Editor now includes the Pine console. We’ve added a new parameter to the plot() , plotchar() , plotcandle() , plotbar() , plotarrow() , plotshape() ,\nand bgcolor() functions: force_overlay - If true, the output will display on the main chart\npane, even when the script occupies a separate pane. The syminfo.* namespace features a new built-in variable: syminfo.expiration_date -\nOn non-continuous futures symbols, returns a UNIX timestamp\nrepresenting the start of the last day of the current contract. The time() and time_close() functions have a new parameter: bars_back - If specified, the function will calculate the\ntimestamp from the bar N bars back relative to the current bar on\nits timeframe. It can also calculate the expected time of a future\nbar up to 500 bars away if the argument is a negative value.\nOptional. The default is 0. We’ve added two new functions for working with strings: str.repeat() -\nConstructs a new string containing the source string repeated a\nspecified number of times with a separator injected between each\nrepeated instance. str.trim() -\nConstructs a new string with all consecutive whitespaces and other\ncontrol characters removed from the left and right of the source\nstring. The request.financial() function now accepts “D” as a period argument, allowing scripts to\nrequest available daily financial data. For example: //@version=5\nindicator(\"Daily financial data demo\") //@variable The daily Premium/Discount to Net Asset Value for \"AMEX:SPY\"\nfloat f1 = request.financial(\"AMEX:SPY\", \"NAV\", \"D\")\nplot(f1) The strategy.* namespace features a new variable for monitoring\navailable capital in a strategy’s simulation: The syminfo.* namespace features new built-in variables: Syminfo: Target price: Recommendations: We’ve added format and precision parameters to all plot*() functions, allowing indicators and strategies to selectively apply\nformatting and decimal precision settings to plotted results in the\nchart pane’s y-axis, the script’s status line, and the Data Window.\nThe arguments passed to these parameters supersede the values in the indicator() and strategy() functions. Both are optional. The defaults for these parameters are the\nsame as the values specified in the script’s declaration statement. For example: //@version=5\nindicator(\"My script\", format = format.percent, precision = 4) plot(close, format = format.price) // Price format with 4-digit precision.\nplot(100 * bar_index / close, precision = 2) // Percent format with 2-digit precision. We’ve added the following variables and functions to the strategy.* namespace: strategy.grossloss_percent -\nThe total gross loss value of all completed losing trades, expressed\nas a percentage of the initial capital. strategy.grossprofit_percent -\nThe total gross profit value of all completed winning trades,\nexpressed as a percentage of the initial capital. strategy.max_runup_percent -\nThe maximum rise from a trough in the equity curve, expressed as a\npercentage of the trough value. strategy.max_drawdown_percent -\nThe maximum drop from a peak in the equity curve, expressed as a\npercentage of the peak value. strategy.netprofit_percent -\nThe total value of all completed trades, expressed as a percentage\nof the initial capital. strategy.openprofit_percent -\nThe current unrealized profit or loss for all open positions,\nexpressed as a percentage of realized equity. strategy.closedtrades.max_drawdown_percent() -\nReturns the maximum drawdown of the closed trade, i.e., the maximum\npossible loss during the trade, expressed as a percentage. strategy.closedtrades.max_runup_percent() -\nReturns the maximum run-up of the closed trade, i.e., the maximum\npossible profit during the trade, expressed as a percentage. strategy.closedtrades.profit_percent() -\nReturns the profit/loss value of the closed trade, expressed as a\npercentage. Losses are expressed as negative values. strategy.opentrades.max_drawdown_percent() -\nReturns the maximum drawdown of the open trade, i.e., the maximum\npossible loss during the trade, expressed as a percentage. strategy.opentrades.max_runup_percent() -\nReturns the maximum run-up of the open trade, i.e., the maximum\npossible profit during the trade, expressed as a percentage. strategy.opentrades.profit_percent() -\nReturns the profit/loss of the open trade, expressed as a\npercentage. Losses are expressed as negative values. Polylines are drawings that sequentially connect the coordinates from an array of up to 10,000 chart points using straight or curved line segments, allowing scripts\nto draw custom formations that are difficult or impossible to achieve\nusing line or box objects. To learn more about this new drawing type, see the Polylines section of our User Manual’s page on Lines and boxes . New functions were added: strategy.default_entry_qty() -\nCalculates the default quantity, in units, of an entry order from strategy.entry() or strategy.order() if it were to fill at the specified fill_price value. chart.point.new() -\nCreates a new chart.point object with the specified time , index , and price . request.seed() -\nRequests data from a user-maintained GitHub repository and returns\nit as a series. An in-depth tutorial on how to add new data can be\nfound here . ticker.inherit() -\nConstructs a ticker ID for the specified symbol with additional\nparameters inherited from the ticker ID passed into the function\ncall, allowing the script to request a symbol’s data using the same\nmodifiers that the from_tickerid has, including extended session,\ndividend adjustment, currency conversion, non-standard chart types,\nback-adjustment, settlement-as-close, etc. timeframe.from_seconds() -\nConverts a specified number of seconds into a valid timeframe\nstring based on our timeframe specification\nformat . The dividends.* namespace now includes variables for retrieving future\ndividend information: dividends.future_amount -\nReturns the payment amount of the upcoming dividend in the currency\nof the current instrument, or na if this data isn’t available. dividends.future_ex_date -\nReturns the Ex-dividend date (Ex-date) of the current instrument’s\nnext dividend payment, or na if this data isn’t available. dividends.future_pay_date -\nReturns the Payment date (Pay date) of the current instrument’s\nnext dividend payment, or na if this data isn’t available. The request.security_lower_tf() function has a new parameter: ignore_invalid_timeframe - Determines how the function behaves\nwhen the chart’s timeframe is smaller than the timeframe value in\nthe function call. If false , the function will raise a runtime\nerror and halt the script’s execution. If true , the function will\nreturn na without raising an error. Users can now explicitly declare variables with the const , simple ,\nand series type qualifiers, allowing more precise control over the\ntypes of variables in their scripts. For example: //@version=5\nindicator(\"My script\") //@variable A constant `string` used as the `title` in the `plot()` function.\nconst string plotTitle = \"My plot\"\n//@variable An `int` variable whose value is consistent after the first chart bar.\nsimple int a = 10\n//@variable An `int` variable whose value can change on every bar.\nseries int b = bar_index plot(b % a, title = plotTitle) Added the following alert placeholders : {{syminfo.currency}} - Returns the currency code of the current\nsymbol (“EUR”, “USD”, etc.). {{syminfo.basecurrency}} - Returns the base currency code of the\ncurrent symbol if the symbol refers to a currency pair. Otherwise,\nit returns na . For example, it returns “EUR” when the symbol is\n“EURUSD”. Maps are collections that hold elements in the form of key-value\npairs . They associate unique keys of a fundamental type with values\nof a built-in or user-defined type. Unlike arrays ,\nthese collections are unordered and do not utilize an internal lookup\nindex. Instead, scripts access the values of maps by referencing the keys from the key-value pairs put into them. For more information on\nthese new collections, see our User Manual’s page on Maps . Fixed an issue that caused strategies to occasionally calculate the\nsizes of limit orders incorrectly due to improper tick rounding of the limit price. Added a new built-in variable to the strategy.* namespace: New syminfo.* built-in variables were added: A new display parameter for all input.*() functions was added.\nIt provides you with more control over the display of input values next to a script’s name.\nFour arguments can be used: display.status_line , display.data_window , display.all ,\nand display.none .\nCombinations of these arguments using plus or minus signs are allowed, and regardless of the argument used,\ninput values will always continue to appear in the Inputs tab of the script’s settings. New parameter added to the strategy.entry() , strategy.order() , strategy.close() , strategy.close_all() ,\nand strategy.exit() functions: disable_alert - Disables order fill alerts for any orders placed\nby the function. Our “Indicator on indicator” feature, which allows a script to pass\nanother indicator’s plot as a source value via the input.source() function, now supports multiple external inputs. Scripts can use a\nmultitude of external inputs originating from up to 10 different\nindicators. We’ve added the following array functions: array.every() -\nReturns true if all elements of the id array are true , false otherwise. array.some() -\nReturns true if at least one element of the id array is true , false otherwise. These functions also work with arrays of int and float types, in which case zero values are considered false , and all others true . Fixed an issue with trailing stops in strategy.exit() being filled on high/low prices rather than on intrabar prices. Fixed behavior of array.mode() , matrix.mode() and ta.mode() .\nNow these functions will return the smallest value when the data has no\nmost frequent value. It is now possible to use seconds-based timeframe strings for the timeframe parameter in request.security() and request.security_lower_tf() . A new function was added: request.currency_rate() -\nprovides a daily rate to convert a value expressed in the from currency to another in the to currency. Pine Script methods are specialized functions associated with specific\ninstances of built-in or user-defined types. They offer a more\nconvenient syntax than standard functions, as users can access methods\nin the same way as object fields using the handy dot notation syntax.\nPine Script includes built-in methods for array , matrix , line , linefill , label , box ,\nand table types and facilitates user-defined methods with the new method keyword. For more details on this new feature, see our User Manual’s page on methods . New array functions were added: Pine objects are instantiations of the new user-defined composite types\n(UDTs) declared using the type keyword. Experienced programmers can think of UDTs as method-less\nclasses. They allow users to create custom types that organize different\nvalues under one logical entity. A detailed rundown of the new\nfunctionality can be found in our User Manual’s page on\nobjects . A new function was added: ticker.standard() -\nCreates a ticker to request data from a standard chart that is\nunaffected by modifiers like extended session, dividend adjustment,\ncurrency conversion, and the calculations of non-standard chart\ntypes: Heikin Ashi, Renko, etc. New strategy.* functions were added: Fixed behaviour of math.round_to_mintick() function. For ‘na’ values it returns ‘na’. Pine Script now has a new, more powerful and better-integrated editor.\nRead our\nblog to find out everything to know about all the new features and upgrades. New overload for the fill() function was added. Now it can create vertical gradients. More info\nabout it in the blog\npost . A new function was added: str.format_time() -\nConverts a timestamp to a formatted string using the specified\nformat and time zone. The text_font_family parameter now allows the selection of a monospace\nfont in label.new() , box.new() and table.cell() function calls, which makes it easier to align text vertically. Its\narguments can be: The accompanying setter functions are: A new label style label.style_text_outline was added. A new parameter for the ta.pivot_point_levels() function was added: developing - If false , the values are those calculated the last\ntime the anchor condition was true. They remain constant until the\nanchor condition becomes true again. If true , the pivots are\ndeveloping, i.e., they constantly recalculate on the data developing\nbetween the point of the last anchor (or bar zero if the anchor\ncondition was never true) and the current bar. Cannot be true when type is set to \"Woodie\" . A new parameter for the box.new() function was added: text_wrap - It defines whether the text is presented in a single\nline, extending past the width of the box if necessary, or wrapped\nso every line is no wider than the box itself. This parameter supports two arguments: New built-in functions were added: ta.min() -\nReturns the all-time low value of source from the beginning of the\nchart up to the current bar. ta.max() -\nReturns the all-time high value of source from the beginning of\nthe chart up to the current bar. A new annotation //@strategy_alert_message was added. If the\nannotation is added to the strategy, the text written after it will be\nautomatically set as the default alert message in the [Create\nAlert] window. //@version=5\n// @strategy_alert_message My Default Alert Message\nstrategy(\"My Strategy\")\nplot(close) It is now possible to fine-tune where a script’s plot values are\ndisplayed through the introduction of new arguments for the display parameter of the plot() , plotchar() , plotshape() , plotarrow() , plotcandle() ,\nand plotbar() functions. Four new arguments were added, complementing the previously available display.all and display.none : display.data_window displays the plot values in the Data Window, one of the items\navailable from the chart’s right sidebar. display.pane displays the plot in the pane where the script resides, as defined\nin with the overlay parameter of the script’s indicator() , strategy() ,\nor library() declaration statement. display.price_scale controls the display of the plot’s label and price in the price\nscale, if the chart’s settings allow them. display.status_line displays the plot values in the script’s status line, next to the\nscript’s name on the chart, if the chart’s settings allow them. The display parameter supports the addition and subtraction of its\narguments: display.all - display.status_line will display the plot’s\ninformation everywhere except in the script’s status line. display.price_scale + display.status_line will display the plot in\nthe price scale and status line only. The behavior of the argument used with the qty_percent parameter of strategy.exit() has changed. Previously, the percentages used on successive exit orders\nof the same position were calculated from the remaining position at any\ngiven time. Instead, the percentages now always apply to the initial\nposition size. When executing the following strategy, for example: //@version=5\nstrategy(\"strategy.exit() example\", overlay = true)\nstrategy.entry(\"Long\", strategy.long, qty = 100)\nstrategy.exit(\"Exit Long1\", \"Long\", trail_points = 50, trail_offset = 0, qty_percent = 20)\nstrategy.exit(\"Exit Long2\", \"Long\", trail_points = 100, trail_offset = 0, qty_percent = 20) 20% of the initial position will be closed on each strategy.exit() call. Before, the first call would exit 20% of the initial position, and\nthe second would exit 20% of the remaining 80% of the position, so only\n16% of the initial position. Two new parameters for the built-in ta.vwap() function were added: anchor - Specifies the condition that triggers the reset of VWAP\ncalculations. When true , calculations reset; when false ,\ncalculations proceed using the values accumulated since the previous\nreset. stdev_mult - If specified, the ta.vwap() calculates the standard deviation bands based on the main VWAP\nseries and returns a [vwap, upper_band, lower_band] tuple. New overloaded versions of the strategy.close() and strategy.close_all() functions with the immediately parameter. When immediately is set to true , the closing order will be executed on the tick where it has been\nplaced, ignoring the strategy parameters that restrict the order\nexecution to the open of the next bar. New built-in functions were added: timeframe.change() -\nReturns true on the first bar of a new timeframe , false otherwise. ta.pivot_point_levels() -\nReturns a float array with numerical values representing 11 pivot\npoint levels: [P, R1, S1, R2, S2, R3, S3, R4, S4, R5, S5] . Levels\nabsent from the specified type return na values. New built-in variables were added: Matrix support has been added to the request.security() function. The historical states of arrays and matrices can now be referenced with the [] operator. In the example below, we reference the historic state of a\nmatrix 10 bars ago: //@version=5\nindicator(\"matrix.new<float> example\")\nm = matrix.new<float>(1, 1, close)\nfloat x = na\nif bar_index > 10 x := matrix.get(m[10], 0, 0)\nplot(x)\nplot(close) The ta.change() function now can take values of int and bool types as its source parameter and return the difference in the\nrespective type. New built-in variables were added: chart.bg_color -\nReturns the color of the chart’s background from the \"Chart settings/Appearance/Background\" field. chart.fg_color -\nReturns a color providing optimal contrast with chart.bg_color . chart.is_standard -\nReturns true if the chart type is bars, candles, hollow candles,\nline, area or baseline, false otherwise. currency.USDT -\nA constant for the Tether currency code. New functions were added: syminfo.prefix() -\nreturns the exchange prefix of the symbol passed to it, e.g.\n“NASDAQ” for “NASDAQ:AAPL”. syminfo.ticker() -\nreturns the ticker of the symbol passed to it without the exchange\nprefix, e.g. “AAPL” for “NASDAQ:AAPL”. request.security_lower_tf() -\nrequests data from a lower timeframe than the chart’s. Added use_bar_magnifier parameter for the strategy() function. When true , the Broker\nEmulator uses lower timeframe data during history backtesting to achieve more\nrealistic results. Fixed behaviour of strategy.exit() function when stop loss triggered at prices outside the bars price\nrange. Added new comment and alert message parameters for the strategy.exit() function: comment_profit - additional notes on the order if the exit was\ntriggered by crossing profit or limit specifically. comment_loss - additional notes on the order if the exit was\ntriggered by crossing stop or loss specifically. comment_trailing - additional notes on the order if the exit was\ntriggered by crossing trail_offset specifically. alert_profit - text that will replace the '{{strategy.order.alert_message}}' placeholder if the exit was\ntriggered by crossing profit or limit specifically. alert_loss - text that will replace the '{{strategy.order.alert_message}}' placeholder if the exit was\ntriggered by crossing stop or loss specifically. alert_trailing - text that will replace the '{{strategy.order.alert_message}}' placeholder if the exit was\ntriggered by crossing trail_offset specifically. Added the display parameter to the following functions: barcolor , bgcolor , fill , hline . A new function was added: request.economic() -\nEconomic data includes information such as the state of a country’s\neconomy or of a particular industry. New built-in variables were added: strategy.max_runup -\nReturns the maximum equity run-up value for the whole trading\ninterval. syminfo.volumetype -\nReturns the volume type of the current symbol. chart.is_heikinashi -\nReturns true if the chart type is Heikin Ashi, false otherwise. chart.is_kagi -\nReturns true if the chart type is Kagi, false otherwise. chart.is_linebreak -\nReturns true if the chart type is Line break, false otherwise. chart.is_pnf -\nReturns true if the chart type is Point & figure, false otherwise. chart.is_range -\nReturns true if the chart type is Range, false otherwise. chart.is_renko -\nReturns true if the chart type is Renko, false otherwise. New matrix functions were added: matrix.new<type>() -\nCreates a new matrix object. A matrix is a two-dimensional data\nstructure containing rows and columns. All elements in the matrix\nmust be of the type specified in the type template (“<type>”). matrix.row() -\nCreates a one-dimensional array from the elements of a matrix row. matrix.col() -\nCreates a one-dimensional array from the elements of a matrix\ncolumn. matrix.get() -\nReturns the element with the specified index of the matrix. matrix.set() -\nAssigns value to the element at the column and row index of\nthe matrix. matrix.rows() -\nReturns the number of rows in the matrix. matrix.columns() -\nReturns the number of columns in the matrix. matrix.elements_count() -\nReturns the total number of matrix elements. matrix.add_row() -\nAdds a row to the matrix.

The first row\nand first column become the last, and the last become the first. matrix.reshape() -\nRebuilds the matrix to rows x cols dimensions. matrix.concat() -\nAppend one matrix to another. matrix.sum() -\nReturns a new matrix resulting from the sum of two matrices, or of a\nmatrix and a scalar (a numerical value). matrix.diff() -\nReturns a new matrix resulting from the subtraction between\nmatrices, or of matrix and a scalar (a numerical value). matrix.mult() -\nReturns a new matrix resulting from the product between the\nmatrices, or between a matrix and a scalar (a numerical value), or\nbetween a matrix and a vector (an array of values). matrix.sort() -\nRearranges the rows in the id matrix following the sorted order of\nthe values in the column . matrix.avg() -\nCalculates the average of all elements in the matrix. matrix.max() -\nReturns the largest value from the matrix elements. matrix.min() -\nReturns the smallest value from the matrix elements. matrix.median() -\nCalculates the median (“the middle” value) of matrix elements. matrix.mode() -\nCalculates the mode of the matrix, which is the most frequently\noccurring value from the matrix elements. When there are multiple\nvalues occurring equally frequently, the function returns the\nsmallest of those values. matrix.pow() -\nCalculates the product of the matrix by itself power times. matrix.det() -\nReturns the determinant of a square matrix. matrix.transpose() -\nCreates a new, transposed version of the matrix by interchanging the\nrow and column index of each element. matrix.pinv() -\nReturns the pseudoinverse of a matrix. matrix.inv() -\nReturns the inverse of a square matrix. matrix.rank() -\nCalculates the rank of the matrix. matrix.trace() -\nCalculates the trace of a matrix (the sum of the main diagonal’s\nelements). matrix.eigenvalues() -\nReturns an array containing the eigenvalues of a square matrix. matrix.eigenvectors() -\nReturns a matrix of eigenvectors, in which each column is an\neigenvector of the matrix. matrix.kron() -\nReturns the Kronecker product for the two matrices. matrix.is_zero() -\nDetermines if all elements of the matrix are zero. matrix.is_identity() -\nDetermines if a matrix is an identity matrix (elements with ones on\nthe main diagonal and zeros elsewhere). matrix.is_binary() -\nDetermines if the matrix is binary (when all elements of the matrix\nare 0 or 1). matrix.is_symmetric() -\nDetermines if a square matrix is symmetric (elements are symmetric\nwith respect to the main diagonal). matrix.is_antisymmetric() -\nDetermines if a matrix is antisymmetric (its transpose equals its\nnegative). matrix.is_diagonal() -\nDetermines if the matrix is diagonal (all elements outside the main\ndiagonal are zero). matrix.is_antidiagonal() -\nDetermines if the matrix is anti-diagonal (all elements outside the\nsecondary diagonal are zero). matrix.is_triangular() -\nDetermines if the matrix is triangular (if all elements above or\nbelow the main diagonal are zero). matrix.is_stochastic() -\nDetermines if the matrix is stochastic. matrix.is_square() -\nDetermines if the matrix is square (it has the same number of rows\nand columns). Added a new parameter for the strategy() function: risk_free_rate - The risk-free rate of return is the annual\npercentage change in the value of an investment with minimal or zero\nrisk, used to calculate the Sharpe and Sortino ratios. New array functions were added: array.sort_indices() -\nreturns an array of indices which, when used to index the original\narray, will access its elements in their sorted order. array.percentrank() -\nreturns the percentile rank of a value in the array. array.percentile_nearest_rank() -\nreturns the value for which the specified percentage of array values\n(percentile) are less than or equal to it, using the nearest-rank\nmethod. array.percentile_linear_interpolation() -\nreturns the value for which the specified percentage of array values\n(percentile) are less than or equal to it, using linear\ninterpolation. array.abs() -\nreturns an array containing the absolute value of each element in\nthe original array. array.binary_search() -\nreturns the index of the value, or -1 if the value is not found. array.binary_search_leftmost() -\nreturns the index of the value if it is found or the index of the\nnext smallest element to the left of where the value would lie if it\nwas in the array. array.binary_search_rightmost() -\nreturns the index of the value if it is found or the index of the\nelement to the right of where the value would lie if it was in the\narray. Added a new optional nth parameter for the array.min() and array.max() functions. Added index in for..in operator. It tracks the current iteration’s index. It is now possible to merge several cells in a table. A merged cell\ndoesn’t have to be a header: you can merge cells in any direction,\nas long as the resulting cell doesn’t affect any already merged\ncells and doesn’t go outside of the table’s bounds. Cells can be\nmerged with the new table.merge_cells() function. Tables now support tooltips, floating labels that appear when you\nhover over a table’s cell. To add a tooltip, pass a string to the tooltip argument of the table.cell() function or use the new table.cell_set_tooltip() function. Added templates and the ability to create arrays via templates. Instead\nof using one of the array.new_*() functions, a template function array.new<type>() can be used. In the example below, we use this functionality to create\nan array filled with float values: //@version=5\nindicator(\"array.new<float> example\")\nlength = 5\nvar a = array.new<float>(length, close)\nif array.size(a) == length array.remove(a, 0) array.push(a, close)\nplot(array.sum(a) / length, \"SMA\") New functions were added: Added new functions to clone drawings: The space between lines drawn in Pine Script can now be filled! We’ve\nadded a new linefill drawing type, along with a number of functions\ndedicated to manipulating it. Linefills are created by passing two lines\nand a color to the linefill.new() function, and their behavior is\nbased on the lines they’re tied to: they extend in the same direction\nas the lines, move when their lines move, and are deleted when one of\nthe two lines is deleted. New linefill-related functions: Added a number of new functions that provide more ways to process\nstrings, and introduce regular expressions to Pine Script: str.contains(source,\nstr) -\nDetermines if the source string contains the str substring. str.pos(source,\nstr) -\nReturns the position of the str string in the source string. str.substring(source, begin_pos,\nend_pos) -\nExtracts a substring from the source string. str.replace(source, target, replacement,\noccurrence) -\nContrary to the existing str.replace_all() function, str.replace() allows the selective replacement of a\nmatched substring with a replacement string. str.lower(source) and str.upper(source) -\nConvert all letters of the source string to lower or upper case: str.startswith(source,\nstr) and str.endswith(source,\nstr) -\nDetermine if the source string starts or ends with the str substring. str.match(source,\nregex) -\nExtracts the substring matching the specified regular\nexpression . Box drawings now supports text. The box.new() function has five new parameters for text manipulation: text , text_size , text_color , text_valign , and text_halign .\nAdditionally, five new functions to set the text properties of existing\nboxes were added: Added new built-in variables that return the bar_index and time values of the last bar in the dataset. Their values are known at the\nbeginning of the script’s calculation: New built-in source variable: hlcc4 -\nA shortcut for (high + low + close + close)/4 . It averages the\nhigh and low values with the double-weighted close. Added a new for…in operator to iterate over all elements of an array: //@version=5\nindicator(\"My Script\")\nint[] a1 = array.from(1, 3, 6, 3, 8, 0, -9, 5) highest(array) => var int highestNum = na for item in array if na(highestNum) or item > highestNum highestNum := item highestNum plot(highest(a1)) Added function overloads. Several functions in a script can now share\nthe same name, as long one of the following conditions is true: Each overload has a different number of parameters: //@version=5\nindicator(\"Function overload\") // Two parameters\nmult(x1, x2) => x1 * x2 // Three parameters\nmult(x1, x2, x3) => x1 * x2 * x3 plot(mult(7, 4))\nplot(mult(7, 4, 2)) When overloads have the same number of parameters, all parameters in\neach overload must be explicitly typified, and their type\ncombinations must be unique: //@version=5\nindicator(\"Function overload\") // Accepts both 'int' and 'float' values - any 'int' can be automatically cast to 'float'\nmult(float x1, float x2) => x1 * x2 // Returns a 'bool' value instead of a number\nmult(bool x1, bool x2) => x1 and x2 ? true : false mult(string x1, string x2) => str.tonumber(x1) * str.tonumber(x2) // Has three parameters, so explicit types are not required\nmult(x1, x2, x3) => x1 * x2 * x3 plot(mult(7, 4))\nplot(mult(7.5, 4.2))\nplot(mult(true, false) ? 1 : 0)\nplot(mult(\"5\", \"6\"))\nplot(mult(7, 4, 2)) Added a new [currency] argument to most request.*() functions. If specified, price values returned by the function will be\nconverted from the source currency to the target currency. The following\nfunctions are affected: Pine Script v5 is here! This is a list of the new features added to\nthe language, and a few of the changes made. See the Pine Script v5 Migration guide for\na complete list of the changes in v5. Libraries are a new type of publication. They allow you to create custom\nfunctions for reuse in other scripts. See this manual’s page on Libraries . Pine Script now supports switch structures! They provide a more convenient and readable alternative to\nlong ternary operators and if statements. while loops are here! They allow you to create a loop that will only stop when\nits controlling condition is false, or a break command is used in the\nloop. New built-in array variables are maintained by the Pine Script runtime\nto hold the IDs of all the active objects of the same type drawn by your\nscript. They are label.all , line.all , box.all and table.all . The runtime.error() function makes it possible to halt the execution of a script and display\na runtime error with a custom message. You can use any condition in your\nscript to trigger the call. Parameter definitions in user-defined functions can now include a\ndefault value: a function defined as f(x = 1) => x will return 1 when\ncalled as f() , i.e., without providing an argument for its x parameter. New variables and functions provide better script visibility on strategy\ninformation: A new earnings.standardized constant for the request.earnings() function allows requesting standardized earnings data. A v4 to v5 converter is now included in the Pine Script Editor. See the\nPine Script v5 Migration guide for more information on converting your scripts to v5. The Reference\nManual now\nincludes the systematic mention of the form and type (e.g., “simple\nint”) required for each function parameter. The User Manual was\nreorganized and new content was added. Many built-in variables, functions and function arguments were renamed\nor moved to new namespaces in v5. The venerable study() , for example,\nis now indicator() ,\nand security() is now request.security() .\nNew namespaces now group related functions and variables together. This\nconsolidation implements a more rational nomenclature and provides an\norderly space to accommodate the many additions planned for Pine\nScript. See the Pine Script v5 Migration guide for\na complete list of the changes made in v5. New parameter has been added for the dividends() , earnings() , financial() , quandl() , security() , and splits() functions: ignore_invalid_symbol - determines the behavior of the function if\nthe specified symbol is not found: if false , the script will halt\nand return a runtime error; if true , the function will return na and execution will continue. tostring now accepts “bool” and “string” types. New argument for time and time_close functions was added: timezone - timezone of the session argument, can only be used\nwhen a session is specified. Can be written out in GMT notation\n(e.g. “GMT-5”) or as an IANA time zone database\nname (e.g. “America/New_York”). It is now possible to place a drawing object in the future with xloc = xloc.bar_index . New argument for study and strategy functions was added: explicit_plot_zorder - specifies the order in which the\nindicator’s plots, fills, and hlines are rendered. If true, the\nplots will be drawn based on the order in which they appear in the\nindicator’s code, each newer plot being drawn above the previous\nones. New variable was added: barstate.islastconfirmedhistory - returns true if script is\nexecuting on the dataset’s last bar when market is closed, or\nscript is executing on the bar immediately preceding the real-time\nbar, if market is open. Returns false otherwise. New function was added: round_to_mintick(x) - returns the value rounded to the symbol’s\nmintick, i.e. the nearest value that can be divided by syminfo.mintick , without the remainder, with ties rounding up. Expanded tostring() functionality. The function now accepts three new\nformatting arguments: format.mintick to format to tick precision. format.volume to abbreviate large values. format.percent to format percentages. Improved backtesting functionality by adding the Leverage mechanism. Added support for table drawings and functions for working with them.\nTables are unique objects that are not anchored to specific bars; they\nfloat in a script’s space, independently of the chart bars being viewed\nor the zoom factor used. For more information, see the Tables User Manual page. New functions were added: color.rgb(red, green, blue, transp) - creates a new color with\ntransparency using the RGB color model. color.from_gradient(value, bottom_value, top_value, bottom_color, top_color) -\nreturns color calculated from the linear gradient between\nbottom_color to top_color. color.r(color) , color.g(color) , color.b(color) , color.t(color) - retrieves the value of one of the color\ncomponents. array.from() - takes a variable number of arguments with one of\nthe types: int , float , bool , string , label , line , color , box , table and returns an array of the corresponding\ntype. A new box drawing has been added to Pine Script, making it possible\nto draw rectangles on charts using the Pine Script syntax. For more\ndetails see the Pine Script reference and the Lines and boxes User Manual page. The color.new function can now accept series and input arguments, in\nwhich case, the colors will be calculated at runtime. For more\ninformation about this, see our Colors User Manual page. New math constants were added: math.pi - is a named constant for Archimedes’ constant. It is\nequal to 3.1415926535897932. math.phi - is a named constant for the golden ratio. It is equal\nto 1.6180339887498948. math.rphi - is a named constant for the golden ratio conjugate. It\nis equal to 0.6180339887498948. math.e - is a named constant for Euler’s number. It is equal to\n2.7182818284590452. New math functions were added: round(x, precision) - returns the value of x rounded to the\nnearest integer, with ties rounding up. If the precision parameter\nis used, returns a float value rounded to that number of decimal\nplaces. median(source, length) - returns the median of the series. mode(source, length) - returns the mode of the series. If there\nare several values with the same frequency, it returns the smallest\nvalue. range(source, length) - returns the difference between the min and max values in a series. todegrees(radians) - returns an approximately equivalent angle in\ndegrees from an angle measured in radians. toradians(degrees) - returns an approximately equivalent angle in\nradians from an angle measured in degrees. random(min, max, seed) - returns a pseudo-random value. The\nfunction will generate a different sequence of values for each\nscript execution. Using the same value for the optional seed\nargument will produce a repeatable sequence. New functions were added: session.ismarket - returns true if the current bar is a part of\nthe regular trading hours (i.e. market hours), false otherwise. session.ispremarket - returns true if the current bar is a part\nof the pre-market, false otherwise. session.ispostmarket - returns true if the current bar is a part\nof the post-market, false otherwise. str.format - converts the values to strings based on the specified\nformats. Accepts certain number modifiers: integer , currency , percent . New assignment operators were added: += - addition assignment -= - subtraction assignment *= - multiplication assignment /= - division assignment %= - modulus assignment New parameters for inputs customization were added: inline - combines all the input calls with the same inline value\nin one line. group - creates a header above all inputs that use the same group\nstring value. The string is also used as the header text. tooltip - adds a tooltip icon to the Inputs menu. The tooltip\nstring is shown when hovering over the tooltip icon. New argument for fill function was added: fillgaps - controls whether fills continue on gaps when one of the plot calls returns an na value. A new keyword was added: varip - is similar to the var keyword, but variables declared\nwith varip retain their values between the updates of a real-time\nbar. New functions were added: tonumber() - converts a string value into a float. time_close() - returns the UNIX timestamp of the close of the\ncurrent bar, based on the resolution and session that is passed to\nthe function. dividends() - requests dividends data for the specified symbol. earnings() - requests earnings data for the specified symbol. splits() - requests splits data for the specified symbol. New arguments for the study() function were added: resolution_gaps - fills the gaps between values fetched from\nhigher timeframes when using resolution . format.percent - formats the script output values as a percentage. New variable was added: time_tradingday - the beginning time of the trading day the\ncurrent bar belongs to. The following functions now accept a series length parameter: A new type of alerts was added - script alerts. More information can be\nfound in our Help\nCenter . New array types were added: array.new_line() array.new_label() array.new_string() New functions were added: str.length() - returns number of chars in source string. array.join() - concatenates all of the elements in the array into\na string and separates these elements with the specified separator. str.split() - splits a string at a given substring separator. New max_labels_count and max_lines_count parameters were added\nto the study and strategy functions. Now you can manage the number\nof lines and labels by setting values for these parameters from 1 to\n500. New function was added: array.range() - return the difference between the min and max\nvalues in the array. The behavior of rising() and falling() functions have changed. For\nexample, rising(close,3) is now calculated as following: close[0] > close[1] and close[1] > close[2] and close[2] > close[3] Added support for input.color to the input() function. Now you can\nprovide script users with color selection through the script’s\n“Settings/Inputs” tab with the same color widget used throughout the\nTradingView user interface. Learn more about this feature in our blog //@version=4\nstudy(\"My Script\", overlay = true)\ncolor c_labelColor = input(color.green, \"Main Color\", input.color)\nvar l = label.new(bar_index, close, yloc = yloc.abovebar, text = \"Colored label\")\nlabel.set_x(l, bar_index)\nlabel.set_color(l, c_labelColor) Added support for arrays and functions for working with them. You can\nnow use the powerful new array feature to build custom datasets. See our User Manual page on\narrays and our blog //@version=4\nstudy(\"My Script\")\na = array.new_float(0)\nfor i = 0 to 5 array.push(a, close[i] - open[i])\nplot(array.get(a, 4)) The following functions now accept a series length parameter. Learn more\nabout this feature in our blog : //@version=4\nstudy(\"My Script\", overlay = true)\nlength = input(10, \"Length\", input.integer, minval = 1, maxval = 100)\navgBar = avg(highestbars(length), lowestbars(length))\nfloat dynLen = nz(abs(avgBar) + 1, length)\ndynSma = sma(close, int(dynLen))\nplot(dynSma) Optimized script compilation time. Scripts now compile 1.5 to 2\ntimes faster. Minor bug fixes and improvements. New resolution parameter was added to the study function. Now\nyou can add MTF functionality to scripts and decide the timeframe\nyou want the indicator to run on. Please note that you need to reapply the indicator in order for the\n[resolution] parameter to appear. The tooltip argument was added to the label.new function along\nwith the label.set_tooltip function: //@version=4\nstudy(\"My Script\", overlay=true)\nvar l=label.new(bar_index, close, yloc=yloc.abovebar, text=\"Label\")\nlabel.set_x(l,bar_index)\nlabel.set_tooltip(l, \"Label Tooltip\") Added an ability to create alerts on\nstrategies . A new function line.get_price() can be used to determine the price level at which the line is\nlocated on a certain bar. New label\nstyles allow you to position the label pointer in any direction. Find and Replace was added to Pine Editor. To use this, press CTRL+F\n(find) or CTRL+H (find and replace). timezone argument was added for time functions. Now you can\nspecify timezone for second , minute , hour , year , month , dayofmonth , dayofweek functions: //@version=4\nstudy(\"My Script\")\nplot(hour(1591012800000, \"GMT+1\")) syminfo.basecurrency variable was added. Returns the base currency\ncode of the current symbol. For EURUSD symbol returns EUR. else if statement was added The behavior of security() function has changed: the expression parameter can be series or tuple. New function was added: quandl() - request quandl data for a symbol New function was added: financial() - request financial data for a symbol New functions for common indicators were added: cmo() - Chande Momentum Oscillator mfi() - Money Flow Index bb() - Bollinger Bands bbw() - Bollinger Bands Width kc() - Keltner Channels kcw() - Keltner Channels Width dmi() - DMI/ADX wpr() - Williams % R hma() - Hull Moving Average supertrend() - SuperTrend Added a detailed description of all the fields in the Strategy Tester\nReport . New Pine Script indicator VWAP Anchored was added. Now you can\nspecify the time period: Session, Month, Week, Year. Fixed a problem with calculating percentrank function. Now it can\nreturn a zero value, which did not happen before due to an incorrect\ncalculation. The default transparency parameter for the plot() , plotshape() , and plotchar() functions is now 0%. For the functions plot() , plotshape() , plotchar() , plotbar() , plotcandle() , plotarrow() , you can set the display parameter, which controls the display of the plot. The\nfollowing values can be assigned to it: display.none - the plot is not displayed display.all - the plot is displayed (Default) The textalign argument was added to the label.new function along\nwith the label.set_textalign function. Using those, you can\ncontrol the alignment of the label’s text: //@version=4\nstudy(\"My Script\", overlay = true)\nvar l = label.new(bar_index, high, text=\"Right\\n aligned\\n text\", textalign=text.align_right)\nlabel.set_xy(l, bar_index, high) .. image:: images/ReleaseNotes-Label_text_align.png New built-in variables were added: iii - Intraday Intensity Index wvad - Williams Variable Accumulation/Distribution wad - Williams Accumulation/Distribution obv - On Balance Volume pvt - Price-Volume Trend nvi - Negative Volume Index pvi - Positive Volume Index New parameters were added for strategy.close() : qty - the number of contracts/shares/lots/units to exit a trade\nwith qty_percent - defines the percentage of entered\ncontracts/shares/lots/units to exit a trade with comment - addtional notes on the order New parameter was added for strategy.close_all : comment - additional notes on the order Warning messages were added. For example, if you don’t specify exit parameters for strategy.exit - profit , limit , loss , stop or one of the\nfollowing pairs: trail_offset and trail_price / trail_points -\nyou will see a warning message in the console in the Pine Script\neditor. Increased the maximum number of arguments in max , min , avg functions. Now you can use up to ten arguments in these functions. plotchar() function now supports most of the Unicode symbols: //@version=4\nstudy(\"My Script\", overlay=true)\nplotchar(open > close, char=\"🐻\") .. image:: images/ReleaseNotes-Bears_in_plotchar.png New bordercolor argument of the plotcandle() function allows you\nto change the color of candles’ borders: //@version=4\nstudy(\"My Script\")\nplotcandle(open, high, low, close, title='Title', color = open < close ? color.green : color.red, wickcolor=color.black, bordercolor=color.orange) New variables added: syminfo.description - returns a description of the current\nsymbol syminfo.currency - returns the currency code of the current\nsymbol (EUR, USD, etc.) syminfo.type - returns the type of the current symbol (stock,\nfutures, index, etc.) New parameters to the strategy function were added: process_orders_on_close allows the broker emulator to try to\nexecute orders after calculating the strategy at the bar’s close close_entries_rule allows to define the sequence used for closing\npositions Some fixes were made: fill() function now works correctly with na as the color parameter value sign() function now calculates correctly for literals and\nconstants str.replace_all(source, target, replacement) function was added. It\nreplaces each occurrence of a target string in the source string\nwith a replacement string New variables added: timeframe.isseconds returns true when current resolution is in\nseconds timeframe.isminutes returns true when current resolution is in\nminutes time_close returns the current bar’s close time The behavior of some functions, variables and operators has changed: The time variable returns the correct open time of the bar for\nmore special cases than before An optional seconds parameter of the timestamp() function allows\nyou to set the time to within seconds security() function: Added the possibility of requesting resolutions in seconds: 1, 5, 15, 30 seconds (chart resolution should be less than or\nequal to the requested resolution) Reduced the maximum value that can be requested in some of the\nother resolutions: from 1 to 1440 minutes from 1 to 365 days from 1 to 52 weeks from 1 to 12 months Changes to the evaluation of ternary operator branches: In Pine Script v3, during the execution of a ternary operator, both\nits branches are calculated, so when this script is added to the\nchart, a long position is opened, even if the long() function is not\ncalled: //@version=3\nstrategy(title = \"My Strategy\")\nlong() => strategy.entry(\"long\", true, 1, when = open > high[1]) 1\nc = 0\nc := true ? 1 : long()\nplot(c) Pine Script v4 contains built-in functions with side effects ( ``line.new`` and ``label.new`` ). If calls to these functions are present in both branches of a ternary operator, both function calls would be executed following v3 conventions. Thus, in Pine Script v4, only the branch corresponding to the evaluated condition is calculated. While this provides a viable solution in some cases, it will modify the behavior of scripts which depended on the fact that both branches of a ternary were evaluated. The solution is to pre-evaluate expressions prior to the ternary operator. The conversion utility takes this requirement into account when converting scripts from v3 to v4, so that script behavior will be identical in v3 and v4. Support for drawing objects. Added label and line drawings var keyword for one time variable initialization Type system improvements: series string data type functions for explicit type casting syntax for explicit variable type declaration new input type forms Renaming of built-ins and a version 3 to 4 converter utility max_bars_back function to control series variables internal\nhistory buffer sizes Pine Script documentation versioning To increase the number of indicators available to the whole\ncommunity, Invite-Only scripts can now be published by Premium users\nonly. Improved the Strategy Tester by reworking the Maximum Drawdown\ncalculation formula. With the new argument show_last in the plot-type functions, you\ncan restrict the number of bars that the plot is displayed on. A major script publishing improvement: it is now possible to update\nyour script without publishing a new one via the Update button in\nthe publishing dialog. Expanded the type system by adding a new type of constants that can\nbe calculated during compilation. Expanded the keyword argument functionality: it is now possible to\nuse keyword arguments in all built-in functions. A new barstate.isconfirmed variable has been added to the list of\nvariables that return bar status. It lets you create indicators that\nare calculated based on the closed bars only. The options argument for the input() function creates an input\nwith a set of options defined by the script’s author. Pine Script v3 is here! Some important changes: Changes to the default behavior of the security() function: it\ncan no longer access the future data by default. This can be\nchanges with the lookahead parameter. An implicit conversion of boolean values to numeric values was\nreplaced with an implicit conversion of numeric values (integer\nand float) to boolean values. Self-referenced and forward-referenced variables were removed.\nAny PineScript code that used those language constructions can\nbe equivalently rewritten using mutable variables. Several improvements to the strategy tester and the strategy report: New Buy & Hold equity graph — a new graph that lets you compare\nperformance of your strategy versus a “buy and hold”, i.e if\nyou just bought a security and held onto it without trading. Added percentage values to the absolute currency values. Added Buy & Hold Return to display the final value of Buy & Hold\nEquity based on last price. Added Sharpe Ratio — it shows the relative effectiveness of the\ninvestment portfolio (security), a measure that indicates the\naverage return minus the risk-free return divided by the\nstandard deviation of return on an investment. Slippage lets you simulate a situation when orders are filled at\na worse price than expected. It can be set through the\nProperties dialog or through the slippage argument in the strategy() function. Commission allows yot to add commission for placed orders in\npercent of order value, fixed price or per contract. The amount\nof commission paid is shown in the Commission Paid field. The\ncommission size and its type can be set through the Properties\ndialog or through the commission_type and commission_value\narguments in the strategy() function. Added invite-only scripts. The invite-only indicators are visible in\nthe Community Scripts, but nobody can use them without explicit\npermission from the author, and only the author can see the source\ncode. Introduded indicator revisions. Each time an indicator is saved, it\ngets a new revision, and it is possible to easily switch to any past\nrevision from the Pine Editor. It is now possible to publish indicators with protected source code.\nThese indicators are available in the public Script Library, and any\nuser can use them, but only the author can see the source code. Improved the behavior of the fill() function: one call can now\nsupport several different colors. Color type variables now have an additional parameter to set default\ntransparency. The transparency can be set with the color.new() function, or by adding an alpha-channel value to a hex color code. Added for loops and keywords break and continue . Pine Script now supports mutable variables! Use the := operator\nto assign a new value to a variable that has already been defined. Multiple improvements and bug fixes for strategies. A new alertcondition() function allows for creating custom alert\nconditions in Pine Script-based indicators. Pine has graduated to v2! The new version of Pine Script added\nsupport for if statements, making it easier to write more readable\nand concise code. Added backtesting functionality to Pine Script. It is now possible\nto create trading strategies, i.e. scripts that can send, modify and\ncancel orders to buy or sell. Strategies allow you to perform\nbacktesting (emulation of strategy trading on historical data) and\nforward testing (emulation of strategy trading on real-time data)\naccording to your algorithms. Detailed information about the\nstrategy’s calculations and the order fills can be seen in the\nnewly added Strategy Tester tab. A new editable parameter allows hiding the plot from the Style\nmenu in the indicator settings so that it is not possible to edit\nits style. The parameter has been added to all the following\nfunctions: all plot-type functions, barcolor() , bgcolor() , hline() , and fill() . Added two new functions to display custom barsets using PineScipt: plotbar() and plotcandle() . Added two new shapes to the plotshape() function: shape.labelup\nand shape.labeldown. PineScipt Editor has been improved and moved to a new panel at the\nbottom of the page. Added a new step argument for the input() function, allowing to\nspecify the step size for the indicator’s inputs. Added support for inputs with the source type to the input() function, allowing to select the data source for the indicator’s\ncalculations from its settings. Added a new text argument to plotshape() and plotchar() functions. Added four new shapes to the plotshape() function: shape.arrowup,\nshape.arrowdown, shape.square, shape.diamond. Improved the script sharing capabilities, changed the layout of the\nIndicators menu and separated published scripts from ideas. Added three new plotting functions, plotshape() , plotchar() , and plotarrow() for situations when you need to highlight specific\nbars on a chart without drawing a line. Integrated QUANDL data into Pine Script. The data can be accessed\nby passing the QUANDL ticker to the security function. Added Pine Script sharing, enabling programmers and traders to\nshare their scripts with the rest of the TradingView community. Added support for inputs, allowing users to edit the indicator\ninputs through the properties window, without needing to edit the\nPine script. Added self-referencing variables. Added support for multiline functions. Implemented the type-casting mechanism, automatically casting\nconstant and simple float and int values to series when it is\nrequired. Added several new functions and improved the existing ones: barssince() and valuewhen() allow you to check conditions on\nhistorical data easier. The new barcolor() function lets you specify a color for a bar\nbased on filling of a certain condition. Similar to the barcolor() function, the bgcolor() function\nchanges the color of the background. Reworked the security() function, further expanding its\nfunctionality. Improved the fill() function, enabling it to be used more than\nonce in one script. Added the round() function to round and convert float values\nto integers. The first version of Pine Script is introduced to all TradingView\nusers, initially as an open beta, on December 13th."}]}

Alerts are created from the charts user\ninterface ( UI ). You will find all the information necessary to\nunderstand how alerts work and how to create them from the charts UI in\nthe Help Center’s About TradingView\nalerts page. Some of the alert types available on TradingView ( generic alerts , drawing alerts and script alerts on order fill events) are created\nfrom symbols or scripts loaded on the chart and do not require specific\ncoding. Any user can create these types of alerts from the charts UI. Other types of alerts ( script alerts triggering on alert() function\ncalls , and alertcondition() alerts ) require specific Pine Script®\ncode to be present in a script to create an alert event before script\nusers can create alerts from them using the charts UI. Additionally,\nwhile script users can create script alerts triggering on order fill\nevents from the charts UI on any strategy loaded on their chart,\nProgrammers can specify explicit order fill alert messages in their\nscript for each type of order filled by the broker emulator. This page covers the different ways Pine Script programmers can code\ntheir scripts to create alert events from which script users will in\nturn be able to create alerts from the charts UI. We will cover: How to use the alert() function to alert() function calls in indicators or strategies,\nwhich can then be included in script alerts created from the\ncharts UI. How to add custom alert messages to be included in script alerts triggering on the order fill events of strategies. How to use the alertcondition() function to generate, in indicators only, alertcondition() events which can then be used to create alertcondition() alerts from the\ncharts UI. Keep in mind that: No alert-related Pine Script code can create a running alert in the\ncharts UI; it merely creates alert events which can then be used by\nscript users to create running alerts from the charts UI. Alerts only trigger in the realtime bar. The operational scope of\nPine Script code dealing with any type of alert is therefore\nrestricted to realtime bars only. When an alert is created in the charts UI, TradingView saves a\nmirror image of the script and its inputs, along with the chart’s\nmain symbol and timeframe to run the alert on its servers.\nSubsequent changes to your script’s inputs or the chart will thus\nnot affect running alerts previously created from them. If you want\nany changes to your context to be reflected in a running alert’s\nbehavior, you will need to delete the alert and create a new one in\nthe new context. The different methods Pine programmers can use today to create alert\nevents in their script are the result of successive enhancements\ndeployed throughout Pine Script’s evolution. The alertcondition() function, which works in indicators only, was the first feature allowing\nPine Script programmers to create alert events. Then came order fill\nalerts for strategies, which trigger when the broker emulator creates order fill events . Order fill events require no special code for\nscript users to create alerts on them, but by way of the alert_message parameter for order-generating strategy.*() functions, programmers can\ncustomize the message of alerts triggering on order fill events by\ndefining a distinct alert message for any number of order fulfillment\nevents. The alert() function is the most recent addition to Pine Script. It more or less\nsupersedes alertcondition() ,\nand when used in strategies, provides a useful complement to alerts on order fill events . For Pine Script programmers, the alert() function will generally be easier and more flexible to work with.\nContrary to alertcondition() ,\nit allows for dynamic alert messages, works in both indicators and\nstrategies and the programmer decides on the frequency of alert() events. While alert() calls can be generated on any logic programmable in Pine, including when\norders are sent to the broker emulator in strategies, they cannot be\ncoded to trigger when orders are executed (or filled ) because\nafter orders are sent to the broker emulator, the emulator controls\ntheir execution and does not report fill events back to the script\ndirectly. When a script user wants to generate an alert on a strategy’s order\nfill events, he must include those events when creating a script alert on the strategy in the “Create Alert” dialog box. No special code is\nrequired in scripts for users to be able to do this. The message sent\nwith order fill events can, however, be customized by programmers\nthrough use of the alert_message parameter in order-generating strategy.*() function calls. A combination of alert() calls and the use of custom alert_message arguments in\norder-generating strategy.*() calls should allow programmers to\ngenerate alert events on most conditions occurring in their script’s\nexecution. The alertcondition() function remains in Pine Script for backward compatibility, but it can\nalso be used advantageously to generate distinct alerts available for\nselection as individual items in the “Create Alert” dialog box’s\n“Condition” field. When a script user creates a script alert using the “Create Alert”\ndialog box, the events able to trigger the alert will vary depending on\nwhether the alert is created from an indicator or a strategy. A script alert created from an indicator will trigger when: The indicator contains alert() calls. The code’s logic allows a specific alert() call to execute. The frequency specified in the alert() call allows the alert to trigger. A script alert created from a strategy can trigger on alert()\nfunction calls , on order fill events , or both. The script user\ncreating an alert on a strategy decides which type of events he wishes\nto include in his script alert . While users can create a script\nalert on order fill events without the need for a strategy to include\nspecial code, it must contain alert() calls for users to include alert() function calls in their script\nalert . The alert() function has the following signature: message A “series string” representing the message text sent when the\nalert triggers. Because this argument allows “series” values, it\ncan be generated at runtime and differ bar to bar, making it\ndynamic. freq An “input string” specifying the triggering frequency of the\nalert. Valid arguments are: alert.freq_once_per_bar : Only the first call per realtime bar\ntriggers the alert (default value). alert.freq_once_per_bar_close : An alert is only triggered when\nthe realtime bar closes and an alert() call is executed during that script iteration. alert.freq_all : All calls during the realtime bar trigger the\nalert. The alert() function can be used in both indicators and strategies. For an alert() call to trigger a script alert configured on alert() function calls ,\nthe script’s logic must allow the alert() call to execute, and the frequency determined by the freq parameter must allow the alert to trigger. Note that by default, strategies are recalculated at the bar’s close,\nso if the alert() function with the frequency alert.freq_all or alert.freq_once_per_bar is used in a strategy, then it will be called\nno more often than once at the bar’s close. In order to enable the alert() function to be called during the bar construction process, you need to\nenable the calc_on_every_tick option. Let’s look at an example where we detect crosses of the RSI centerline: //@version=6\nindicator(\"All `alert()` calls\")\nr = ta.rsi(close, 20) // Detect crosses.\nxUp = ta.crossover( r, 50)\nxDn = ta.crossunder(r, 50)\n// Trigger an alert on crosses.\nif xUp alert(\"Go long (RSI is \" + str.tostring(r, \"#.00)\"))\nelse if xDn alert(\"Go short (RSI is \" + str.tostring(r, \"#.00)\")) plotchar(xUp, \"Go Long\", \"▲\", location.bottom, color.lime, size = size.tiny)\nplotchar(xDn, \"Go Short\", \"▼\", location.top, color.red, size = size.tiny)\nhline(50)\nplot(r) If a script alert is created from this script: When RSI crosses the centerline up, the script alert will trigger\nwith the “Go long…” message. When RSI crosses the centerline\ndown, the script alert will trigger with the “Go short…”\nmessage. Because no argument is specified for the freq parameter in the alert() call, the default value of alert.freq_once_per_bar will be used,\nso the alert will only trigger the first time each of the alert() calls is executed during the realtime bar. The message sent with the alert is composed of two parts: a constant\nstring and then the result of the str.tostring() call which will include the value of RSI at the moment where the alert() call is executed by the script. An alert message for a cross up\nwould look like: “Go long (RSI is 53.41)“. Because a script alert always triggers on any occurrence of a call\nto alert() ,\nas long as the frequency used in the call allows for it, this\nparticular script does not allow a script user to restrict his script alert to longs only, for example. Note that: Contrary to an alertcondition() call which is always placed at column 0 (in the script’s global\nscope), the alert() call is placed in the local scope of an if branch so it only executes when our triggering condition is met. If\nan alert() call was placed in the script’s global scope at column 0, it would\nexecute on all bars, which would likely not be the desired behavior. An alertcondition() could not accept the same string we use for our alert’s message\nbecause of its use of the str.tostring() call. alertcondition() messages must be constant strings. Lastly, because alert() messages can be constructed dynamically at runtime, we could have used\nthe following code to generate our alert events: // Trigger an alert on crosses.\nif xUp or xDn firstPart = (xUp ? \"Go long\" : \"Go short\") + \" (RSI is \" alert(firstPart + str.tostring(r, \"#.00)\")) When users create a script alert on alert() function calls , the\nalert will trigger on any call the script makes to the alert() function, provided its frequency constraints are met. If you want to\nallow your script’s users to select which alert() function call in your script will trigger a script alert , you will\nneed to provide them with the means to indicate their preference in your\nscript’s inputs, and code the appropriate logic in your script. This\nway, script users will be able to create multiple script alerts from a\nsingle script, each behaving differently as per the choices made in the\nscript’s inputs prior to creating the alert in the charts UI. Suppose, for our next example, that we want to provide the option of\ntriggering alerts on only longs, only shorts, or both. You could code\nyour script like this: //@version=6\nindicator(\"Selective `alert()` calls\")\ndetectLongsInput = input.bool(true, \"Detect Longs\")\ndetectShortsInput = input.bool(true, \"Detect Shorts\")\nrepaintInput = input.bool(false, \"Allow Repainting\") r = ta.rsi(close, 20)\n// Detect crosses.\nxUp = ta.crossover( r, 50)\nxDn = ta.crossunder(r, 50)\n// Only generate entries when the trade's direction is allowed in inputs.\nenterLong = detectLongsInput and xUp and (repaintInput or barstate.isconfirmed)\nenterShort = detectShortsInput and xDn and (repaintInput or barstate.isconfirmed)\n// Trigger the alerts only when the compound condition is met.\nif enterLong alert(\"Go long (RSI is \" + str.tostring(r, \"#.00)\"))\nelse if enterShort alert(\"Go short (RSI is \" + str.tostring(r, \"#.00)\")) plotchar(enterLong, \"Go Long\", \"▲\", location.bottom, color.lime, size = size.tiny)\nplotchar(enterShort, \"Go Short\", \"▼\", location.top, color.red, size = size.tiny)\nhline(50)\nplot(r) Note how: We create a compound condition that is met only when the user’s\nselection allows for an entry in that direction. A long entry on a\ncrossover of the centerline only triggers the alert when long\nentries have been enabled in the script’s Inputs. We offer the user to indicate his repainting preference. When he\ndoes not allow the calculations to repaint, we wait until the bar’s\nconfirmation to trigger the compound condition. This way, the alert\nand the marker only appear at the end of the realtime bar. If a user of this script wanted to create two distinct script alerts\nfrom this script, i.e., one triggering only on longs, and one only\non shorts, then he would need to: Select only “Detect Longs” in the inputs and create a first script alert on the script. Select only “Detect Shorts” in the Inputs and create another script alert on the script. alert() function calls can be used in strategies also, with the provision that\nstrategies, by default, only execute on the close of realtime bars. Unless calc_on_every_tick = true is used in the strategy() declaration statement, all alert() calls will use the alert.freq_once_per_bar_close frequency, regardless\nof the argument used for freq . While script alerts on strategies will use order fill events to\ntrigger alerts when the broker emulator fills orders, alert() can be used advantageously to generate other alert events in strategies. This strategy creates alert() function calls when RSI moves against\nthe trade for three consecutive bars: //@version=6\nstrategy(\"Strategy with selective `alert()` calls\")\nr = ta.rsi(close, 20) // Detect crosses.\nxUp = ta.crossover( r, 50)\nxDn = ta.crossunder(r, 50)\n// Place orders on crosses.\nif xUp strategy.entry(\"Long\", strategy.long)\nelse if xDn strategy.entry(\"Short\", strategy.short) // Trigger an alert when RSI diverges from our trade's direction.\ndivInLongTrade = strategy.position_size > 0 and ta.falling(r, 3)\ndivInShortTrade = strategy.position_size < 0 and ta.rising( r, 3)\nif divInLongTrade alert(\"WARNING: Falling RSI\", alert.freq_once_per_bar_close)\nif divInShortTrade alert(\"WARNING: Rising RSI\", alert.freq_once_per_bar_close) plotchar(xUp, \"Go Long\", \"▲\", location.bottom, color.lime, size = size.tiny)\nplotchar(xDn, \"Go Short\", \"▼\", location.top, color.red, size = size.tiny)\nplotchar(divInLongTrade, \"WARNING: Falling RSI\", \"•\", location.top, color.red, size = size.tiny)\nplotchar(divInShortTrade, \"WARNING: Rising RSI\", \"•\", location.bottom, color.lime, size = size.tiny)\nhline(50)\nplot(r) If a user created a script alert from this strategy and included both order fill events and alert() function calls in his alert, the alert\nwould trigger whenever an order is executed, or when one of the alert() calls was executed by the script on the realtime bar’s closing\niteration, i.e., when barstate.isrealtime and barstate.isconfirmed are both true. The alert() function events in the script would only\ntrigger the alert when the realtime bar closes because alert.freq_once_per_bar_close is the argument used for the freq parameter in the alert() calls. When a script alert is created from an indicator, it can only trigger\non alert() function calls . However, when a script alert is created\nfrom a strategy, the user can specify that order fill events also\ntrigger the script alert . An order fill event is any event generated\nby the broker emulator which causes a simulated order to be executed. It\nis the equivalent of a trade order being filled by a broker/exchange.\nOrders are not necessarily executed when they are placed. In a strategy,\nthe execution of orders can only be detected indirectly and after the\nfact, by analyzing changes in built-in variables such as strategy.opentrades or strategy.position_size . Script alerts configured on order fill events are thus useful in\nthat they allow the triggering of alerts at the precise moment of an\norder’s execution, before a script’s logic can detect it. Pine Script programmers can customize the alert message sent when\nspecific orders are executed. While this is not a pre-requisite for order fill events to trigger, custom alert messages can be useful\nbecause they allow custom syntax to be included with alerts in order to\nroute actual orders to a third-party execution engine, for example.\nSpecifying custom alert messages for specific order fill events is\ndone by means of the alert_message parameter in functions which can\ngenerate orders: strategy.close() , strategy.entry() , strategy.exit() and strategy.order() . The argument used for the alert_message parameter is a “series\nstring”, so it can be constructed dynamically using any variable\navailable to the script, as long as it is converted to string format. Let’s look at a strategy where we use the alert_message parameter in\nboth our strategy.entry() calls: //@version=6\nstrategy(\"Strategy using `alert_message`\")\nr = ta.rsi(close, 20) // Detect crosses.\nxUp = ta.crossover( r, 50)\nxDn = ta.crossunder(r, 50)\n// Place order on crosses using a custom alert message for each.\nif xUp strategy.entry(\"Long\", strategy.long, stop = high, alert_message = \"Stop-buy executed (stop was \" + str.tostring(high) + \")\")\nelse if xDn strategy.entry(\"Short\", strategy.short, stop = low, alert_message = \"Stop-sell executed (stop was \" + str.tostring(low) + \")\") plotchar(xUp, \"Go Long\", \"▲\", location.bottom, color.lime, size = size.tiny)\nplotchar(xDn, \"Go Short\", \"▼\", location.top, color.red, size = size.tiny)\nhline(50)\nplot(r) Note that: We use the stop parameter in our strategy.entry() calls, which creates stop-buy and stop-sell orders. This entails\nthat buy orders will only execute once price is higher than the high on the bar where the order is placed, and sell orders will\nonly execute once price is lower than the [low] on the\nbar where the order is placed. The up/down arrows which we plot with plotchar() are plotted when orders are placed . Any number of bars may\nelapse before the order is actually executed, and in some cases the\norder will never be executed because price does not meet the\nrequired condition. Because we use the same id argument for all buy orders, any new\nbuy order placed before a previous order’s condition is met will\nreplace that order. The same applies to sell orders. Variables included in the alert_message argument are evaluated\nwhen the order is executed, so when the alert triggers. When the alert_message parameter is used in a strategy’s\norder-generating strategy.*() function calls, script users must\ninclude the {{strategy.order.alert_message}} placeholder in the\n“Create Alert” dialog box’s “Message” field when creating script\nalerts on order fill events . This is required so the alert_message argument used in the order-generating strategy.*() function calls is\nused in the message of alerts triggering on each order fill event .\nWhen only using the {{strategy.order.alert_message}} placeholder in\nthe “Message” field and the alert_message parameter is present in\nonly some of the order-generating strategy.*() function calls in your\nstrategy, an empty string will replace the placeholder in the message of\nalerts triggered by any order-generating strategy.*() function call\nnot using the alert_message parameter. While other placeholders can be used in the “Create Alert” dialog\nbox’s “Message” field by users creating alerts on order fill\nevents , they cannot be used in the argument of alert_message . The alertcondition() function allows programmers to create individual alertcondition events in their indicators. One indicator may contain more than one alertcondition() call. Each call to alertcondition() in a script will create a corresponding alert selectable in the\n“Condition” dropdown menu of the “Create Alert” dialog box. While the presence of alertcondition() calls in a strategy script will not cause a compilation error,\nalerts cannot be created from them. The alertcondition() function has the following signature: alertcondition(condition, title, message) condition A “series bool” value ( true or false ) which determines when\nthe alert will trigger. It is a required argument. When the value is true the alert will trigger. When the value is false the alert\nwill not trigger. Contrary to alert() function calls, alertcondition() calls must start at column zero of a line, so cannot be placed in\nconditional blocks. title A “const string” optional argument that sets the name of the alert\ncondition as it will appear in the “Create Alert” dialog box’s\n“Condition” field in the charts UI. If no argument is supplied,\n“Alert” will be used. message A “const string” optional argument that specifies the text message\nto display when the alert triggers. The text will appear in the\n“Message” field of the “Create Alert” dialog box, from where\nscript users can then modify it when creating an alert. As this\nargument must be a “const string”, it must be known at compilation\ntime and thus cannot vary bar to bar. It can, however, contain\nplaceholders which will be replaced at runtime by dynamic values\nthat may change bar to bar. See this page’s Placeholders section for a list. The alertcondition() function does not include a freq parameter. The frequency of alertcondition() alerts is determined by users in the “Create Alert”\ndialog box. Here is an example of code creating alertcondition() events : //@version=6\nindicator(\"`alertcondition()` on single condition\")\nr = ta.rsi(close, 20) xUp = ta.crossover( r, 50)\nxDn = ta.crossunder(r, 50) plot(r, \"RSI\")\nhline(50)\nplotchar(xUp, \"Long\", \"▲\", location.bottom, color.lime, size = size.tiny)\nplotchar(xDn, \"Short\", \"▼\", location.top, color.red, size = size.tiny) alertcondition(xUp, \"Long Alert\", \"Go long\")\nalertcondition(xDn, \"Short Alert\", \"Go short \") Because we have two alertcondition() calls in our script, two different alerts will be available in the\n“Create Alert” dialog box’s “Condition” field: “Long Alert” and\n“Short Alert”. If we wanted to include the value of RSI when the cross occurs, we could\nnot simply add its value to the message string using str.tostring(r) , as we could in an alert() call or in an alert_message argument in a strategy. We can, however,\ninclude it using a placeholder. This shows two alternatives: alertcondition(xUp, \"Long Alert\", \"Go long. RSI is {{plot_0}}\")\nalertcondition(xDn, \"Short Alert\", 'Go short. RSI is {{plot(\"RSI\")}}') Note that: The first line uses the {{plot_0}} placeholder, where the plot\nnumber corresponds to the order of the plot in the script. The second line uses the {{plot(\"[plot_title]\")}} type of\nplaceholder, which must include the title of the plot() call used in our script to plot RSI. Double quotes are used to wrap\nthe plot’s title inside the {{plot(\"RSI\")}} placeholder. This\nrequires that we use single quotes to wrap the message string. Using one of these methods, we can include any numeric value that is\nplotted by our indicator, but as strings cannot be plotted, no\nstring variable can be used. If we want to offer script users the possiblity of creating a single\nalert from an indicator using multiple alertcondition() calls, we will need to provide options in the script’s inputs through\nwhich users will indicate the conditions they want to trigger their\nalert before creating it. This script demonstrates one way to do it: //@version=6\nindicator(\"`alertcondition()` on multiple conditions\")\ndetectLongsInput = input.bool(true, \"Detect Longs\")\ndetectShortsInput = input.bool(true, \"Detect Shorts\") r = ta.rsi(close, 20)\n// Detect crosses.\nxUp = ta.crossover( r, 50)\nxDn = ta.crossunder(r, 50)\n// Only generate entries when the trade's direction is allowed in inputs.\nenterLong = detectLongsInput and xUp\nenterShort = detectShortsInput and xDn plot(r)\nplotchar(enterLong, \"Go Long\", \"▲\", location.bottom, color.lime, size = size.tiny)\nplotchar(enterShort, \"Go Short\", \"▼\", location.top, color.red, size = size.tiny)\nhline(50)\n// Trigger the alert when one of the conditions is met.\nalertcondition(enterLong or enterShort, \"Compound alert\", \"Entry\") Note how the alertcondition() call is allowed to trigger on one of two conditions. Each condition can\nonly trigger the alert if the user enables it in the script’s inputs\nbefore creating the alert. These placeholders can be used in the message argument of alertcondition() calls. They will be replaced with dynamic values when the alert\ntriggers. They are the only way to include dynamic values (values that\ncan vary bar to bar) in alertcondition() messages. Note that users creating alertcondition() alerts from the “Create\nAlert” dialog box in the charts UI are also able to use these\nplaceholders in the dialog box’s “Message” field. {{exchange}} Exchange of the symbol used in the alert (NASDAQ, NYSE, MOEX, etc.).\nNote that for delayed symbols, the exchange will end with “_DL” or\n“_DLY.” For example, “NYMEX_DL.” {{interval}} Returns the timeframe of the chart the alert is created on. Note\nthat Range charts are calculated based on 1m data, so the\nplaceholder will always return “1” on any alert created on a Range\nchart. {{open}} , {{high}} , {{low}} , {{close}} , {{volume}} Corresponding values of the bar on which the alert has been\ntriggered. {{plot_0}} , {{plot_1}} , […], {{plot_19}} Value of the corresponding plot number. Plots are numbered from zero\nto 19 in order of appearance in the script, so only one of the first\n20 plots can be used. For example, the built-in “Volume” indicator\nhas two output series: Volume and Volume MA, so you could use the\nfollowing: alertcondition(volume > ta.sma(volume,20), \"Volume alert\", \"Volume ({{plot_0}}) > average ({{plot_1}})\") {{plot(\"[plot_title]\")}} This placeholder can be used when one needs to refer to a plot using\nthe title argument used in a plot() call. Note that double quotation marks ( \" ) must be used inside\nthe placeholder to wrap the title argument. This requires that a\nsingle quotation mark ( ' ) be used to wrap the message string: //@version=6\nindicator(\"\")\nr = ta.rsi(close, 14)\nxUp = ta.crossover(r, 50)\nplot(r, \"RSI\", display = display.none)\nalertcondition(xUp, \"xUp alert\", message = 'RSI is bullish at: {{plot(\"RSI\")}}') {{ticker}} Ticker of the symbol used in the alert (AAPL, BTCUSD, etc.). {{time}} Returns the time at the beginning of the bar. Time is UTC, formatted\nas yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ , so for example: 2019-08-27T09:56:00Z . {{timenow}} Current time when the alert triggers, formatted in the same way as {{time}} . The precision is to the nearest second, regardless of\nthe chart’s timeframe. The most common instances of repainting traders want to avoid with\nalerts are ones where they must prevent an alert from triggering at some\npoint during the realtime bar when it would not have triggered at\nits close. This can happen when these conditions are met: The calculations used in the condition triggering the alert can vary\nduring the realtime bar. This will be the case with any calculation\nusing high , low or close , for example, which includes almost\nall built-in indicators. It will also be the case with the result of\nany request.security() call using a higher timeframe than the chart’s, when the higher\ntimeframe’s current bar has not closed yet. The alert can trigger before the close of the realtime bar, so with\nany frequency other than “Once Per Bar Close”. The simplest way to avoid this type of repainting is to configure the\ntriggering frequency of alerts so they only trigger on the close of the\nrealtime bar. There is no panacea; avoiding this type of repainting always entails waiting for confirmed information, which means the\ntrader must sacrifice immediacy to achieve reliability. Note that other types of repainting such as those documented in our Repainting section may\nnot be preventable by simply triggering alerts on the close of realtime\nbars."}]}

Understanding all three is key to making the most of the\npower of Pine Script. The execution model determines how your script is executed on charts,\nand thus how the code you write in scripts works. Your code would do\nnothing were it not for Pine Script’s runtime, which kicks in after\nyour code has compiled and it is executed on your chart because one of\nthe events triggering the execution of a script has occurred. When a Pine script is loaded on a chart it executes once on each\nhistorical bar using the available OHLCV (open, high, low, close,\nvolume) values for each bar. Once the script’s execution reaches the\nrightmost bar in the dataset, if trading is currently active on the\nchart’s symbol, then Pine Script indicators will execute once every\ntime an update occurs, i.e., price or volume changes. Pine Script strategies will by default only execute when the rightmost bar closes,\nbut they can also be configured to execute on every update, like\nindicators do. All symbol/timeframe pairs have a dataset comprising a limited number of\nbars. When you scroll a chart to the left to see the dataset’s earlier\nbars, the corresponding bars are loaded on the chart. The loading\nprocess stops when there are no more bars for that particular\nsymbol/timeframe pair or the maximum number of\nbars your account type permits has been loaded. You can scroll the chart to\nthe left until the very first bar of the dataset, which has an index\nvalue of 0 (see bar_index ). When the script first runs on a chart, all bars in a dataset are historical bars , except the rightmost one if a trading session is\nactive. When trading is active on the rightmost bar, it is called the realtime bar . The realtime bar updates when a price or volume change\nis detected. When the realtime bar closes, it becomes an elapsed\nrealtime bar and a new realtime bar opens. Let’s take a simple script and follow its execution on historical bars: //@version=6\nindicator(\"My Script\", overlay = true)\nsrc = close\na = ta.sma(src, 5)\nb = ta.sma(src, 50)\nc = ta.cross(a, b)\nplot(a, color = color.blue)\nplot(b, color = color.black)\nplotshape(c, color = color.red) On historical bars, a script executes at the equivalent of the bar’s\nclose, when the OHLCV values are all known for that bar. Prior to\nexecution of the script on a bar, the built-in variables such as open , high , low , close , volume and time are set to values\ncorresponding to those from that bar. A script executes once per\nhistorical bar . Our example script is first executed on the very first bar of the\ndataset at index 0. Each statement is executed using the values for the\ncurrent bar. Accordingly, on the first bar of the dataset, the following\nstatement: src = close initializes the variable src with the close value for that first\nbar, and each of the next lines is executed in turn. Because the script\nonly executes once for each historical bar, the script will always\ncalculate using the same close value for a specific historical bar. The execution of each line in the script produces calculations which in\nturn generate the indicator’s output values, which can then be plotted\non the chart. Our example uses the plot and plotshape calls at the\nend of the script to output some values. In the case of a strategy, the\noutcome of the calculations can be used to plot values or dictate the\norders to be placed. After execution and plotting on the first bar, the script is executed on\nthe dataset’s second bar, which has an index of 1. The process then\nrepeats until all historical bars in the dataset are processed and the\nscript reaches the rightmost bar on the chart. The behavior of a Pine script on the realtime bar is very different than\non historical bars. Recall that the realtime bar is the rightmost bar on\nthe chart when trading is active on the chart’s symbol. Also, recall\nthat strategies can behave in two different ways in the realtime bar. By\ndefault, they only execute when the realtime bar closes, but the calc_on_every_tick parameter of the strategy declaration statement\ncan be set to true to modify the strategy’s behavior so that it\nexecutes each time the realtime bar updates, as indicators do. The\nbehavior described here for indicators will thus only apply to\nstrategies using calc_on_every_tick=true . The most important difference between execution of scripts on historical\nand realtime bars is that while they execute only once on historical\nbars, scripts execute every time an update occurs during a realtime bar.\nThis entails that built-in variables such as high , low and close which never change on a historical bar, can change at each of a\nscript’s iteration in the realtime bar. Changes in the built-in\nvariables used in the script’s calculations will, in turn, induce\nchanges in the results of those calculations. This is required for the\nscript to follow the realtime price action. As a result, the same script\nmay produce different results every time it executes during the realtime\nbar. Note: In the realtime bar, the close variable always represents\nthe current price . Similarly, the high and low built-in\nvariables represent the highest high and lowest low reached since the\nrealtime bar’s beginning. Pine Script’s built-in variables will only\nrepresent the realtime bar’s final values on the bar’s last update. Let’s follow our script example in the realtime bar. When the script arrives on the realtime bar it executes a first time. It\nuses the current values of the built-in variables to produce a set of\nresults and plots them if required. Before the script executes another\ntime when the next update happens, its user-defined variables are reset\nto a known state corresponding to that of the last commit at the close\nof the previous bar. If no commit was made on the variables because they\nare initialized every bar, then they are reinitialized. In both cases\ntheir last calculated state is lost. The state of plotted labels and\nlines is also reset. This resetting of the script’s user-defined\nvariables and drawings prior to each new iteration of the script in the\nrealtime bar is called rollback . Its effect is to reset the script to\nthe same known state it was in when the realtime bar opened, so\ncalculations in the realtime bar are always performed from a clean\nstate. The constant recalculation of a script’s values as price or volume\nchanges in the realtime bar can lead to a situation where variable c in our example becomes true because a cross has occurred, and so the red\nmarker plotted by the script’s last line would appear on the chart. If\non the next price update the price has moved in such a way that the close value no longer produces calculations making c true because\nthere is no longer a cross, then the marker previously plotted will\ndisappear. When the realtime bar closes, the script executes a last time. As usual,\nvariables are rolled back prior to execution. However, since this\niteration is the last one on the realtime bar, variables are committed\nto their final values for the bar when calculations are completed. To summarize the realtime bar process: A script executes at the open of the realtime bar and then once per update . Variables are rolled back before every realtime update . Variables are committed once at the closing bar update . A script executes across all available bars in a dataset when one of the following conditions occurs: The user adds the script to their chart from the Pine Editor or the “Indicators, Metrics & Strategies” menu. The user saves a new version of the source code while the script is on the chart. The chart uses a new timeframe . The chart uses a dataset with a new ticker identifier . Several user actions affect a chart’s ticker ID, such as selecting a symbol from the “Symbol search” menu, switching between standard and non-standard chart types, activating Bar Replay mode, and toggling data modifications from the chart’s settings. The user changes any input available in the script’s “Settings/Inputs” tab. The user updates a strategy property from the “Settings/Properties” tab. The script uses the chart.left_visible_bar_time or chart.right_visible_bar_time variable in its calculations or logic, and the user changes the variable’s value by scrolling or zooming on the chart. The system detects a browser refresh event. The user opens or closes the Pine Logs pane. The user activates or deactivates the Pine Profiler . Either of the following triggers script executions on a realtime bar while the chart symbol’s session is active: One of the conditions above occurs, causing the script to execute across the entire dataset up to the latest bar. The realtime bar’s values change after new price or volume data becomes available. The script performs a new execution on that bar to use the latest information in its calculations. Note that when a chart is left untouched when the market is active, a\nsuccession of realtime bars which have been opened and then closed will\ntrail the current realtime bar. While these elapsed realtime bars will\nhave been confirmed because their variables have all been committed,\nthe script will not yet have executed on them in their historical state, since they did not exist when the script was last run on the\nchart’s dataset. When an event triggers the execution of the script on the chart and\ncauses it to run on those bars which have now become historical bars,\nthe script’s calculation can sometimes vary from what they were when\ncalculated on the last closing update of the same bars when they were\nrealtime bars. This can be caused by slight variations between the OHLCV\nvalues saved at the close of realtime bars and those fetched from data\nfeeds when the same bars have become historical bars. This behavior is\none of the possible causes of repainting . The built-in barstate.* variables provide information on the type of bar or the event where the script is executing. The page where they are\ndocumented also contains a script that allows you to visualize the\ndifference between elapsed realtime and historical bars, for\nexample. The Strategies page\nexplains the details of strategy calculations, which are not\nidentical to those of indicators. Every function call in Pine leaves a trail of historical values that a\nscript can access on subsequent bars using the [] operator. The historical series of functions depend on successive calls\nto record the output on every bar. When a script does not call functions\non each bar, it can produce an inconsistent history that may impact\ncalculations and results, namely when it depends on the continuity of\ntheir historical series to operate as expected. The compiler warns users\nin these cases to make them aware that the values from a function,\nwhether built-in or user-defined, might be misleading. To demonstrate, let’s write a script that calculates the index of the\ncurrent bar and outputs that value on every second bar. In the following\nscript, we’ve defined a calcBarIndex() function that adds 1 to the\nprevious value of its internal index variable on every bar. The script\ncalls the function on each bar that the condition returns true on\n(every other bar) to update the customIndex value. It plots this value\nalongside the built-in bar_index to validate the output: //@version=6\nindicator(\"My script\") //@function Calculates the index of the current bar by adding 1 to its own value from the previous bar.\n// The first bar will have an index of 0.\ncalcBarIndex() => int index = na index := nz(index[1], replacement = -1) + 1 //@variable Returns `true` on every other bar.\ncondition = bar_index % 2 == 0 int customIndex = na // Call `calcBarIndex()` when the `condition` is `true`. This prompts the compiler to raise a warning.\nif condition customIndex := calcBarIndex() plot(bar_index, \"Bar index\", color = color.green)\nplot(customIndex, \"Custom index\", color = color.red, style = plot.style_cross) Note that: The nz() function replaces na values with a specified replacement value (0 by default). On the\nfirst bar of the script, when the index series has no history, the na value is replaced with -1 before adding 1 to return an initial value\nof 0. Upon inspecting the chart, we see that the two plots differ wildly. The\nreason for this behavior is that the script called calcBarIndex() within the scope of an if structure on every other bar, resulting in a historical output\ninconsistent with the bar_index series. When calling the function once\nevery two bars, internally referencing the previous value of index gets the value from two bars ago, i.e., the last bar the function\nexecuted on. This behavior results in a customIndex value of half that\nof the built-in bar_index . To align the calcBarIndex() output with the bar_index , we can move\nthe function call to the script’s global scope. That way, the function\nwill execute on every bar, allowing its entire history to be recorded\nand referenced rather than only the results from every other bar. In the\ncode below, we’ve defined a globalScopeBarIndex variable in the\nglobal scope and assigned it to the return from calcBarIndex() rather\nthan calling the function locally. The script sets the customIndex to\nthe value of globalScopeBarIndex on the occurrence of the condition : //@version=6\nindicator(\"My script\") //@function Calculates the index of the current bar by adding 1 to its own value from the previous bar.\n// The first bar will have an index of 0.\ncalcBarIndex() => int index = na index := nz(index[1], replacement = -1) + 1 //@variable Returns `true` on every second bar.\ncondition = bar_index % 2 == 0 globalScopeBarIndex = calcBarIndex()\nint customIndex = na // Assign `customIndex` to `globalScopeBarIndex` when the `condition` is `true`. This won't produce a warning.\nif condition customIndex := globalScopeBarIndex plot(bar_index, \"Bar index\", color = color.green)\nplot(customIndex, \"Custom index\", color = color.red, style = plot.style_cross) This behavior can also radically impact built-in functions that\nreference history internally. For example, the ta.sma() function references its past values “under the hood”. If a script\ncalls this function conditionally rather than on every bar, the values\nwithin the calculation can change significantly. We can ensure\ncalculation consistency by assigning ta.sma() to a variable in the global scope and referencing that variable’s\nhistory as needed. The following example calculates three SMA series: controlSMA , localSMA , and globalSMA . The script calculates controlSMA in the\nglobal scope and localSMA within the local scope of an if structure. Within the if structure, it also updates the value of globalSMA using the controlSMA value. As we can see, the values from the globalSMA and controlSMA series align, whereas the localSMA series diverges from\nthe other two because it uses an incomplete history, which affects its\ncalculations: //@version=6\nindicator(\"My script\") //@variable Returns `true` on every second bar.\ncondition = bar_index % 2 == 0 controlSMA = ta.sma(close, 20)\nfloat globalSMA = na\nfloat localSMA = na // Update `globalSMA` and `localSMA` when `condition` is `true`.\nif condition globalSMA := controlSMA // No warning. localSMA := ta.sma(close, 20) // Raises warning. This function depends on its history to work as intended. plot(controlSMA, \"Control SMA\", color = color.green)\nplot(globalSMA, \"Global SMA\", color = color.blue, style = plot.style_cross)\nplot(localSMA, \"Local SMA\", color = color.red, style = plot.style_cross) This behavior is required because forcing the execution of functions on\neach bar would lead to unexpected results in those functions that\nproduce side effects, i.e., the ones that do something aside from\nreturning the value. For example, the label.new() function creates a label on the chart, so forcing it to be called on\nevery bar even when it is inside of an if structure would create labels where they should not logically appear. Not all built-in functions use their previous values in their\ncalculations, meaning not all require execution on every bar. For\nexample, math.max() compares all arguments passed into it to return the highest value. Such\nfunctions that do not interact with their history in any way do not\nrequire special treatment. If the usage of a function within a conditional block does not cause a\ncompiler warning, it’s safe to use without impacting calculations.\nOtherwise, move the function call to the global scope to force\nconsistent execution. When keeping a function call within a conditional\nblock despite the warning, ensure the output is correct at the very\nleast to avoid unexpected results."}]}

Alerts are created from the charts user\ninterface ( UI ). You will find all the information necessary to\nunderstand how alerts work and how to create them from the charts UI in\nthe Help Center’s About TradingView\nalerts page. Some of the alert types available on TradingView ( generic alerts , drawing alerts and script alerts on order fill events) are created\nfrom symbols or scripts loaded on the chart and do not require specific\ncoding. Any user can create these types of alerts from the charts UI. Other types of alerts ( script alerts triggering on alert() function\ncalls , and alertcondition() alerts ) require specific Pine Script®\ncode to be present in a script to create an alert event before script\nusers can create alerts from them using the charts UI. Additionally,\nwhile script users can create script alerts triggering on order fill\nevents from the charts UI on any strategy loaded on their chart,\nProgrammers can specify explicit order fill alert messages in their\nscript for each type of order filled by the broker emulator. This page covers the different ways Pine Script programmers can code\ntheir scripts to create alert events from which script users will in\nturn be able to create alerts from the charts UI. We will cover: How to use the alert() function to alert() function calls in indicators or strategies,\nwhich can then be included in script alerts created from the\ncharts UI. How to add custom alert messages to be included in script alerts triggering on the order fill events of strategies. How to use the alertcondition() function to generate, in indicators only, alertcondition() events which can then be used to create alertcondition() alerts from the\ncharts UI. Keep in mind that: No alert-related Pine Script code can create a running alert in the\ncharts UI; it merely creates alert events which can then be used by\nscript users to create running alerts from the charts UI. Alerts only trigger in the realtime bar. The operational scope of\nPine Script code dealing with any type of alert is therefore\nrestricted to realtime bars only. When an alert is created in the charts UI, TradingView saves a\nmirror image of the script and its inputs, along with the chart’s\nmain symbol and timeframe to run the alert on its servers.\nSubsequent changes to your script’s inputs or the chart will thus\nnot affect running alerts previously created from them. If you want\nany changes to your context to be reflected in a running alert’s\nbehavior, you will need to delete the alert and create a new one in\nthe new context. The different methods Pine programmers can use today to create alert\nevents in their script are the result of successive enhancements\ndeployed throughout Pine Script’s evolution. The alertcondition() function, which works in indicators only, was the first feature allowing\nPine Script programmers to create alert events. Then came order fill\nalerts for strategies, which trigger when the broker emulator creates order fill events . Order fill events require no special code for\nscript users to create alerts on them, but by way of the alert_message parameter for order-generating strategy.*() functions, programmers can\ncustomize the message of alerts triggering on order fill events by\ndefining a distinct alert message for any number of order fulfillment\nevents. The alert() function is the most recent addition to Pine Script. It more or less\nsupersedes alertcondition() ,\nand when used in strategies, provides a useful complement to alerts on order fill events . For Pine Script programmers, the alert() function will generally be easier and more flexible to work with.\nContrary to alertcondition() ,\nit allows for dynamic alert messages, works in both indicators and\nstrategies and the programmer decides on the frequency of alert() events. While alert() calls can be generated on any logic programmable in Pine, including when\norders are sent to the broker emulator in strategies, they cannot be\ncoded to trigger when orders are executed (or filled ) because\nafter orders are sent to the broker emulator, the emulator controls\ntheir execution and does not report fill events back to the script\ndirectly. When a script user wants to generate an alert on a strategy’s order\nfill events, he must include those events when creating a script alert on the strategy in the “Create Alert” dialog box. No special code is\nrequired in scripts for users to be able to do this. The message sent\nwith order fill events can, however, be customized by programmers\nthrough use of the alert_message parameter in order-generating strategy.*() function calls. A combination of alert() calls and the use of custom alert_message arguments in\norder-generating strategy.*() calls should allow programmers to\ngenerate alert events on most conditions occurring in their script’s\nexecution. The alertcondition() function remains in Pine Script for backward compatibility, but it can\nalso be used advantageously to generate distinct alerts available for\nselection as individual items in the “Create Alert” dialog box’s\n“Condition” field. When a script user creates a script alert using the “Create Alert”\ndialog box, the events able to trigger the alert will vary depending on\nwhether the alert is created from an indicator or a strategy. A script alert created from an indicator will trigger when: The indicator contains alert() calls. The code’s logic allows a specific alert() call to execute. The frequency specified in the alert() call allows the alert to trigger. A script alert created from a strategy can trigger on alert()\nfunction calls , on order fill events , or both. The script user\ncreating an alert on a strategy decides which type of events he wishes\nto include in his script alert . While users can create a script\nalert on order fill events without the need for a strategy to include\nspecial code, it must contain alert() calls for users to include alert() function calls in their script\nalert . The alert() function has the following signature: message A “series string” representing the message text sent when the\nalert triggers. Because this argument allows “series” values, it\ncan be generated at runtime and differ bar to bar, making it\ndynamic. freq An “input string” specifying the triggering frequency of the\nalert. Valid arguments are: alert.freq_once_per_bar : Only the first call per realtime bar\ntriggers the alert (default value). alert.freq_once_per_bar_close : An alert is only triggered when\nthe realtime bar closes and an alert() call is executed during that script iteration. alert.freq_all : All calls during the realtime bar trigger the\nalert. The alert() function can be used in both indicators and strategies. For an alert() call to trigger a script alert configured on alert() function calls ,\nthe script’s logic must allow the alert() call to execute, and the frequency determined by the freq parameter must allow the alert to trigger. Note that by default, strategies are recalculated at the bar’s close,\nso if the alert() function with the frequency alert.freq_all or alert.freq_once_per_bar is used in a strategy, then it will be called\nno more often than once at the bar’s close. In order to enable the alert() function to be called during the bar construction process, you need to\nenable the calc_on_every_tick option. Let’s look at an example where we detect crosses of the RSI centerline: //@version=6\nindicator(\"All `alert()` calls\")\nr = ta.rsi(close, 20) // Detect crosses.\nxUp = ta.crossover( r, 50)\nxDn = ta.crossunder(r, 50)\n// Trigger an alert on crosses.\nif xUp alert(\"Go long (RSI is \" + str.tostring(r, \"#.00)\"))\nelse if xDn alert(\"Go short (RSI is \" + str.tostring(r, \"#.00)\")) plotchar(xUp, \"Go Long\", \"▲\", location.bottom, color.lime, size = size.tiny)\nplotchar(xDn, \"Go Short\", \"▼\", location.top, color.red, size = size.tiny)\nhline(50)\nplot(r) If a script alert is created from this script: When RSI crosses the centerline up, the script alert will trigger\nwith the “Go long…” message. When RSI crosses the centerline\ndown, the script alert will trigger with the “Go short…”\nmessage. Because no argument is specified for the freq parameter in the alert() call, the default value of alert.freq_once_per_bar will be used,\nso the alert will only trigger the first time each of the alert() calls is executed during the realtime bar. The message sent with the alert is composed of two parts: a constant\nstring and then the result of the str.tostring() call which will include the value of RSI at the moment where the alert() call is executed by the script. An alert message for a cross up\nwould look like: “Go long (RSI is 53.41)“. Because a script alert always triggers on any occurrence of a call\nto alert() ,\nas long as the frequency used in the call allows for it, this\nparticular script does not allow a script user to restrict his script alert to longs only, for example. Note that: Contrary to an alertcondition() call which is always placed at column 0 (in the script’s global\nscope), the alert() call is placed in the local scope of an if branch so it only executes when our triggering condition is met. If\nan alert() call was placed in the script’s global scope at column 0, it would\nexecute on all bars, which would likely not be the desired behavior. An alertcondition() could not accept the same string we use for our alert’s message\nbecause of its use of the str.tostring() call. alertcondition() messages must be constant strings. Lastly, because alert() messages can be constructed dynamically at runtime, we could have used\nthe following code to generate our alert events: // Trigger an alert on crosses.\nif xUp or xDn firstPart = (xUp ? \"Go long\" : \"Go short\") + \" (RSI is \" alert(firstPart + str.tostring(r, \"#.00)\")) When users create a script alert on alert() function calls , the\nalert will trigger on any call the script makes to the alert() function, provided its frequency constraints are met. If you want to\nallow your script’s users to select which alert() function call in your script will trigger a script alert , you will\nneed to provide them with the means to indicate their preference in your\nscript’s inputs, and code the appropriate logic in your script. This\nway, script users will be able to create multiple script alerts from a\nsingle script, each behaving differently as per the choices made in the\nscript’s inputs prior to creating the alert in the charts UI. Suppose, for our next example, that we want to provide the option of\ntriggering alerts on only longs, only shorts, or both. You could code\nyour script like this: //@version=6\nindicator(\"Selective `alert()` calls\")\ndetectLongsInput = input.bool(true, \"Detect Longs\")\ndetectShortsInput = input.bool(true, \"Detect Shorts\")\nrepaintInput = input.bool(false, \"Allow Repainting\") r = ta.rsi(close, 20)\n// Detect crosses.\nxUp = ta.crossover( r, 50)\nxDn = ta.crossunder(r, 50)\n// Only generate entries when the trade's direction is allowed in inputs.\nenterLong = detectLongsInput and xUp and (repaintInput or barstate.isconfirmed)\nenterShort = detectShortsInput and xDn and (repaintInput or barstate.isconfirmed)\n// Trigger the alerts only when the compound condition is met.\nif enterLong alert(\"Go long (RSI is \" + str.tostring(r, \"#.00)\"))\nelse if enterShort alert(\"Go short (RSI is \" + str.tostring(r, \"#.00)\")) plotchar(enterLong, \"Go Long\", \"▲\", location.bottom, color.lime, size = size.tiny)\nplotchar(enterShort, \"Go Short\", \"▼\", location.top, color.red, size = size.tiny)\nhline(50)\nplot(r) Note how: We create a compound condition that is met only when the user’s\nselection allows for an entry in that direction. A long entry on a\ncrossover of the centerline only triggers the alert when long\nentries have been enabled in the script’s Inputs. We offer the user to indicate his repainting preference. When he\ndoes not allow the calculations to repaint, we wait until the bar’s\nconfirmation to trigger the compound condition. This way, the alert\nand the marker only appear at the end of the realtime bar. If a user of this script wanted to create two distinct script alerts\nfrom this script, i.e., one triggering only on longs, and one only\non shorts, then he would need to: Select only “Detect Longs” in the inputs and create a first script alert on the script. Select only “Detect Shorts” in the Inputs and create another script alert on the script. alert() function calls can be used in strategies also, with the provision that\nstrategies, by default, only execute on the close of realtime bars. Unless calc_on_every_tick = true is used in the strategy() declaration statement, all alert() calls will use the alert.freq_once_per_bar_close frequency, regardless\nof the argument used for freq . While script alerts on strategies will use order fill events to\ntrigger alerts when the broker emulator fills orders, alert() can be used advantageously to generate other alert events in strategies. This strategy creates alert() function calls when RSI moves against\nthe trade for three consecutive bars: //@version=6\nstrategy(\"Strategy with selective `alert()` calls\")\nr = ta.rsi(close, 20) // Detect crosses.\nxUp = ta.crossover( r, 50)\nxDn = ta.crossunder(r, 50)\n// Place orders on crosses.\nif xUp strategy.entry(\"Long\", strategy.long)\nelse if xDn strategy.entry(\"Short\", strategy.short) // Trigger an alert when RSI diverges from our trade's direction.\ndivInLongTrade = strategy.position_size > 0 and ta.falling(r, 3)\ndivInShortTrade = strategy.position_size < 0 and ta.rising( r, 3)\nif divInLongTrade alert(\"WARNING: Falling RSI\", alert.freq_once_per_bar_close)\nif divInShortTrade alert(\"WARNING: Rising RSI\", alert.freq_once_per_bar_close) plotchar(xUp, \"Go Long\", \"▲\", location.bottom, color.lime, size = size.tiny)\nplotchar(xDn, \"Go Short\", \"▼\", location.top, color.red, size = size.tiny)\nplotchar(divInLongTrade, \"WARNING: Falling RSI\", \"•\", location.top, color.red, size = size.tiny)\nplotchar(divInShortTrade, \"WARNING: Rising RSI\", \"•\", location.bottom, color.lime, size = size.tiny)\nhline(50)\nplot(r) If a user created a script alert from this strategy and included both order fill events and alert() function calls in his alert, the alert\nwould trigger whenever an order is executed, or when one of the alert() calls was executed by the script on the realtime bar’s closing\niteration, i.e., when barstate.isrealtime and barstate.isconfirmed are both true. The alert() function events in the script would only\ntrigger the alert when the realtime bar closes because alert.freq_once_per_bar_close is the argument used for the freq parameter in the alert() calls. When a script alert is created from an indicator, it can only trigger\non alert() function calls . However, when a script alert is created\nfrom a strategy, the user can specify that order fill events also\ntrigger the script alert . An order fill event is any event generated\nby the broker emulator which causes a simulated order to be executed. It\nis the equivalent of a trade order being filled by a broker/exchange.\nOrders are not necessarily executed when they are placed. In a strategy,\nthe execution of orders can only be detected indirectly and after the\nfact, by analyzing changes in built-in variables such as strategy.opentrades or strategy.position_size . Script alerts configured on order fill events are thus useful in\nthat they allow the triggering of alerts at the precise moment of an\norder’s execution, before a script’s logic can detect it. Pine Script programmers can customize the alert message sent when\nspecific orders are executed. While this is not a pre-requisite for order fill events to trigger, custom alert messages can be useful\nbecause they allow custom syntax to be included with alerts in order to\nroute actual orders to a third-party execution engine, for example.\nSpecifying custom alert messages for specific order fill events is\ndone by means of the alert_message parameter in functions which can\ngenerate orders: strategy.close() , strategy.entry() , strategy.exit() and strategy.order() . The argument used for the alert_message parameter is a “series\nstring”, so it can be constructed dynamically using any variable\navailable to the script, as long as it is converted to string format. Let’s look at a strategy where we use the alert_message parameter in\nboth our strategy.entry() calls: //@version=6\nstrategy(\"Strategy using `alert_message`\")\nr = ta.rsi(close, 20) // Detect crosses.\nxUp = ta.crossover( r, 50)\nxDn = ta.crossunder(r, 50)\n// Place order on crosses using a custom alert message for each.\nif xUp strategy.entry(\"Long\", strategy.long, stop = high, alert_message = \"Stop-buy executed (stop was \" + str.tostring(high) + \")\")\nelse if xDn strategy.entry(\"Short\", strategy.short, stop = low, alert_message = \"Stop-sell executed (stop was \" + str.tostring(low) + \")\") plotchar(xUp, \"Go Long\", \"▲\", location.bottom, color.lime, size = size.tiny)\nplotchar(xDn, \"Go Short\", \"▼\", location.top, color.red, size = size.tiny)\nhline(50)\nplot(r) Note that: We use the stop parameter in our strategy.entry() calls, which creates stop-buy and stop-sell orders. This entails\nthat buy orders will only execute once price is higher than the high on the bar where the order is placed, and sell orders will\nonly execute once price is lower than the [low] on the\nbar where the order is placed. The up/down arrows which we plot with plotchar() are plotted when orders are placed . Any number of bars may\nelapse before the order is actually executed, and in some cases the\norder will never be executed because price does not meet the\nrequired condition. Because we use the same id argument for all buy orders, any new\nbuy order placed before a previous order’s condition is met will\nreplace that order. The same applies to sell orders. Variables included in the alert_message argument are evaluated\nwhen the order is executed, so when the alert triggers. When the alert_message parameter is used in a strategy’s\norder-generating strategy.*() function calls, script users must\ninclude the {{strategy.order.alert_message}} placeholder in the\n“Create Alert” dialog box’s “Message” field when creating script\nalerts on order fill events . This is required so the alert_message argument used in the order-generating strategy.*() function calls is\nused in the message of alerts triggering on each order fill event .\nWhen only using the {{strategy.order.alert_message}} placeholder in\nthe “Message” field and the alert_message parameter is present in\nonly some of the order-generating strategy.*() function calls in your\nstrategy, an empty string will replace the placeholder in the message of\nalerts triggered by any order-generating strategy.*() function call\nnot using the alert_message parameter. While other placeholders can be used in the “Create Alert” dialog\nbox’s “Message” field by users creating alerts on order fill\nevents , they cannot be used in the argument of alert_message . The alertcondition() function allows programmers to create individual alertcondition events in their indicators. One indicator may contain more than one alertcondition() call. Each call to alertcondition() in a script will create a corresponding alert selectable in the\n“Condition” dropdown menu of the “Create Alert” dialog box. While the presence of alertcondition() calls in a strategy script will not cause a compilation error,\nalerts cannot be created from them. The alertcondition() function has the following signature: alertcondition(condition, title, message) condition A “series bool” value ( true or false ) which determines when\nthe alert will trigger. It is a required argument. When the value is true the alert will trigger. When the value is false the alert\nwill not trigger. Contrary to alert() function calls, alertcondition() calls must start at column zero of a line, so cannot be placed in\nconditional blocks. title A “const string” optional argument that sets the name of the alert\ncondition as it will appear in the “Create Alert” dialog box’s\n“Condition” field in the charts UI. If no argument is supplied,\n“Alert” will be used. message A “const string” optional argument that specifies the text message\nto display when the alert triggers. The text will appear in the\n“Message” field of the “Create Alert” dialog box, from where\nscript users can then modify it when creating an alert. As this\nargument must be a “const string”, it must be known at compilation\ntime and thus cannot vary bar to bar. It can, however, contain\nplaceholders which will be replaced at runtime by dynamic values\nthat may change bar to bar. See this page’s Placeholders section for a list. The alertcondition() function does not include a freq parameter. The frequency of alertcondition() alerts is determined by users in the “Create Alert”\ndialog box. Here is an example of code creating alertcondition() events : //@version=6\nindicator(\"`alertcondition()` on single condition\")\nr = ta.rsi(close, 20) xUp = ta.crossover( r, 50)\nxDn = ta.crossunder(r, 50) plot(r, \"RSI\")\nhline(50)\nplotchar(xUp, \"Long\", \"▲\", location.bottom, color.lime, size = size.tiny)\nplotchar(xDn, \"Short\", \"▼\", location.top, color.red, size = size.tiny) alertcondition(xUp, \"Long Alert\", \"Go long\")\nalertcondition(xDn, \"Short Alert\", \"Go short \") Because we have two alertcondition() calls in our script, two different alerts will be available in the\n“Create Alert” dialog box’s “Condition” field: “Long Alert” and\n“Short Alert”. If we wanted to include the value of RSI when the cross occurs, we could\nnot simply add its value to the message string using str.tostring(r) , as we could in an alert() call or in an alert_message argument in a strategy. We can, however,\ninclude it using a placeholder. This shows two alternatives: alertcondition(xUp, \"Long Alert\", \"Go long. RSI is {{plot_0}}\")\nalertcondition(xDn, \"Short Alert\", 'Go short. RSI is {{plot(\"RSI\")}}') Note that: The first line uses the {{plot_0}} placeholder, where the plot\nnumber corresponds to the order of the plot in the script. The second line uses the {{plot(\"[plot_title]\")}} type of\nplaceholder, which must include the title of the plot() call used in our script to plot RSI. Double quotes are used to wrap\nthe plot’s title inside the {{plot(\"RSI\")}} placeholder. This\nrequires that we use single quotes to wrap the message string. Using one of these methods, we can include any numeric value that is\nplotted by our indicator, but as strings cannot be plotted, no\nstring variable can be used. If we want to offer script users the possiblity of creating a single\nalert from an indicator using multiple alertcondition() calls, we will need to provide options in the script’s inputs through\nwhich users will indicate the conditions they want to trigger their\nalert before creating it. This script demonstrates one way to do it: //@version=6\nindicator(\"`alertcondition()` on multiple conditions\")\ndetectLongsInput = input.bool(true, \"Detect Longs\")\ndetectShortsInput = input.bool(true, \"Detect Shorts\") r = ta.rsi(close, 20)\n// Detect crosses.\nxUp = ta.crossover( r, 50)\nxDn = ta.crossunder(r, 50)\n// Only generate entries when the trade's direction is allowed in inputs.\nenterLong = detectLongsInput and xUp\nenterShort = detectShortsInput and xDn plot(r)\nplotchar(enterLong, \"Go Long\", \"▲\", location.bottom, color.lime, size = size.tiny)\nplotchar(enterShort, \"Go Short\", \"▼\", location.top, color.red, size = size.tiny)\nhline(50)\n// Trigger the alert when one of the conditions is met.\nalertcondition(enterLong or enterShort, \"Compound alert\", \"Entry\") Note how the alertcondition() call is allowed to trigger on one of two conditions. Each condition can\nonly trigger the alert if the user enables it in the script’s inputs\nbefore creating the alert. These placeholders can be used in the message argument of alertcondition() calls. They will be replaced with dynamic values when the alert\ntriggers. They are the only way to include dynamic values (values that\ncan vary bar to bar) in alertcondition() messages. Note that users creating alertcondition() alerts from the “Create\nAlert” dialog box in the charts UI are also able to use these\nplaceholders in the dialog box’s “Message” field. {{exchange}} Exchange of the symbol used in the alert (NASDAQ, NYSE, MOEX, etc.).\nNote that for delayed symbols, the exchange will end with “_DL” or\n“_DLY.” For example, “NYMEX_DL.” {{interval}} Returns the timeframe of the chart the alert is created on. Note\nthat Range charts are calculated based on 1m data, so the\nplaceholder will always return “1” on any alert created on a Range\nchart. {{open}} , {{high}} , {{low}} , {{close}} , {{volume}} Corresponding values of the bar on which the alert has been\ntriggered. {{plot_0}} , {{plot_1}} , […], {{plot_19}} Value of the corresponding plot number. Plots are numbered from zero\nto 19 in order of appearance in the script, so only one of the first\n20 plots can be used. For example, the built-in “Volume” indicator\nhas two output series: Volume and Volume MA, so you could use the\nfollowing: alertcondition(volume > ta.sma(volume,20), \"Volume alert\", \"Volume ({{plot_0}}) > average ({{plot_1}})\") {{plot(\"[plot_title]\")}} This placeholder can be used when one needs to refer to a plot using\nthe title argument used in a plot() call. Note that double quotation marks ( \" ) must be used inside\nthe placeholder to wrap the title argument. This requires that a\nsingle quotation mark ( ' ) be used to wrap the message string: //@version=6\nindicator(\"\")\nr = ta.rsi(close, 14)\nxUp = ta.crossover(r, 50)\nplot(r, \"RSI\", display = display.none)\nalertcondition(xUp, \"xUp alert\", message = 'RSI is bullish at: {{plot(\"RSI\")}}') {{ticker}} Ticker of the symbol used in the alert (AAPL, BTCUSD, etc.). {{time}} Returns the time at the beginning of the bar. Time is UTC, formatted\nas yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ , so for example: 2019-08-27T09:56:00Z . {{timenow}} Current time when the alert triggers, formatted in the same way as {{time}} . The precision is to the nearest second, regardless of\nthe chart’s timeframe. The most common instances of repainting traders want to avoid with\nalerts are ones where they must prevent an alert from triggering at some\npoint during the realtime bar when it would not have triggered at\nits close. This can happen when these conditions are met: The calculations used in the condition triggering the alert can vary\nduring the realtime bar. This will be the case with any calculation\nusing high , low or close , for example, which includes almost\nall built-in indicators. It will also be the case with the result of\nany request.security() call using a higher timeframe than the chart’s, when the higher\ntimeframe’s current bar has not closed yet. The alert can trigger before the close of the realtime bar, so with\nany frequency other than “Once Per Bar Close”. The simplest way to avoid this type of repainting is to configure the\ntriggering frequency of alerts so they only trigger on the close of the\nrealtime bar. There is no panacea; avoiding this type of repainting always entails waiting for confirmed information, which means the\ntrader must sacrifice immediacy to achieve reliability. Note that other types of repainting such as those documented in our Repainting section may\nnot be preventable by simply triggering alerts on the close of realtime\nbars."}]}

Scripts\nthat follow our best practices will be easier to read, understand and\nmaintain. You can see scripts using these guidelines published from the TradingView and PineCoders accounts on the platform. We recommend the use of: camelCase for all identifiers, i.e., variable or function names: ma , maFast , maLengthInput , maColor , roundedOHLC() , pivotHi() . All caps SNAKE_CASE for constants: BULL_COLOR , BEAR_COLOR , MAX_LOOKBACK . The use of qualifying suffixes when it provides valuable clues about\nthe type or provenance of a variable: maShowInput , bearColor , bearColorInput , volumesArray , maPlotID , resultsTable , levelsColorArray . The Pine Script® compiler is quite forgiving of the positioning of\nspecific statements or the version compiler annotation in the script. While other arrangements are syntactically\ncorrect, this is how we recommend organizing scripts: If you publish your open-source scripts publicly on TradingView (scripts\ncan also be published privately), your open-source code is by default\nprotected by the Mozilla license. You may choose any other license you\nprefer. The reuse of code from those scripts is governed by our House Rules on\nScript\nPublishing which preempt the author’s license. The standard license comments appearing at the beginning of scripts are: // This source code is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License 2.0 at https://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/\n// © username This is the compiler annotation defining the version of Pine Script the script will use. If\nnone is present, v1 is used. For v6, use: //@version=6 This is the mandatory declaration statement which defines the type of\nyour script. It must be a call to either indicator() , strategy() ,\nor library() . If your script uses one or more Pine Script libraries , your import statements belong here. Scripts can declare variables qualified as “const”, i.e., ones\nreferencing a constant value. We refer to variables as “constants” when they meet these criteria: Their declaration uses the optional const keyword (see our User\nManual’s section on type qualifiers for more information). They are initialized using a literal (e.g., 100 or \"AAPL\" ) or a\nbuilt-in qualified as “const” (e.g., color.green ). Their value does not change during the script’s execution. We use SNAKE_CASE to name these variables and group their declaration\nnear the top of the script. For example: // ————— Constants\nint MS_IN_MIN = 60 * 1000\nint MS_IN_HOUR = MS_IN_MIN * 60\nint MS_IN_DAY = MS_IN_HOUR * 24 color GRAY = #808080ff\ncolor LIME = #00FF00ff\ncolor MAROON = #800000ff\ncolor ORANGE = #FF8000ff\ncolor PINK = #FF0080ff\ncolor TEAL = #008080ff\ncolor BG_DIV = color.new(ORANGE, 90)\ncolor BG_RESETS = color.new(GRAY, 90) string RST1 = \"No reset; cumulate since the beginning of the chart\"\nstring RST2 = \"On a stepped higher timeframe (HTF)\"\nstring RST3 = \"On a fixed HTF\"\nstring RST4 = \"At a fixed time\"\nstring RST5 = \"At the beginning of the regular session\"\nstring RST6 = \"At the first visible chart bar\"\nstring RST7 = \"Fixed rolling period\" string LTF1 = \"Least precise, covering many chart bars\"\nstring LTF2 = \"Less precise, covering some chart bars\"\nstring LTF3 = \"More precise, covering less chart bars\"\nstring LTF4 = \"Most precise, 1min intrabars\" string TT_TOTVOL = \"The 'Bodies' value is the transparency of the total volume candle bodies. Zero is opaque, 100 is transparent.\"\nstring TT_RST_HTF = \"This value is used when '\" + RST3 +\"' is selected.\"\nstring TT_RST_TIME = \"These values are used when '\" + RST4 +\"' is selected. A reset will occur when the time is greater or equal to the bar's open time, and less than its close time.\\nHour: 0-23\\nMinute: 0-59\"\nstring TT_RST_PERIOD = \"This value is used when '\" + RST7 +\"' is selected.\" In this example: The RST* and LTF* constants will be used as tuple elements in\nthe options argument of input.*() calls. The TT_* constants will be used as tooltip arguments in input.*() calls. Note how we use a line continuation for long\nstring literals. We do not use var to initialize constants. The Pine Script runtime is optimized to\nhandle declarations on each bar, but using var to initialize a variable only the first time it is declared incurs a\nminor penalty on script performance because of the maintenance that var variables require on further bars. Note that: Literals used in more than one place in a script should always be\ndeclared as a constant. Using the constant rather than the literal\nmakes it more readable if it is given a meaningful name, and the\npractice makes code easier to maintain. Even though the quantity of\nmilliseconds in a day is unlikely to change in the future, MS_IN_DAY is more meaningful than 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 . Constants only used in the local block of a function or if , while ,\netc., statement for example, can be declared in that local block. It is much easier to read scripts when all their inputs are in the\nsame code section. Placing that section at the beginning of the script\nalso reflects how they are processed at runtime, i.e., before the rest\nof the script is executed. Suffixing input variable names with input makes them more readily\nidentifiable when they are used later in the script: maLengthInput , bearColorInput , showAvgInput , etc. // ————— Inputs\nstring resetInput = input.string(RST2, \"CVD Resets\", inline = \"00\", options = [RST1, RST2, RST3, RST4, RST5, RST6, RST7])\nstring fixedTfInput = input.timeframe(\"D\", \" Fixed HTF: \", tooltip = TT_RST_HTF)\nint hourInput = input.int(9, \" Fixed time hour: \", inline = \"01\", minval = 0, maxval = 23)\nint minuteInput = input.int(30, \"minute\", inline = \"01\", minval = 0, maxval = 59, tooltip = TT_RST_TIME)\nint fixedPeriodInput = input.int(20, \" Fixed period: \", inline = \"02\", minval = 1, tooltip = TT_RST_PERIOD)\nstring ltfModeInput = input.string(LTF3, \"Intrabar precision\", inline = \"03\", options = [LTF1, LTF2, LTF3, LTF4]) All user-defined functions must be defined in the script’s global\nscope; nested function definitions are not allowed in Pine Script. Optimal function design should minimize the use of global variables in\nthe function’s scope, as they undermine function portability. When it\ncan’t be avoided, those functions must follow the global variable\ndeclarations in the code, which entails they can’t always be placed in\nthe <function_declarations> section. Such dependencies on global\nvariables should ideally be documented in the function’s comments. It will also help readers if you document the function’s objective,\nparameters and result. The same syntax used in libraries can be used to\ndocument your functions. This can make it easier to port your functions\nto a library should you ever decide to do so: //@version=6\nindicator(\"<function_declarations>\", \"\", true) string SIZE_LARGE = \"Large\"\nstring SIZE_NORMAL = \"Normal\"\nstring SIZE_SMALL = \"Small\" string sizeInput = input.string(SIZE_NORMAL, \"Size\", options = [SIZE_LARGE, SIZE_NORMAL, SIZE_SMALL]) // @function Used to produce an argument for the `size` parameter in built-in functions.\n// @param userSize (simple string) User-selected size.\n// @returns One of the `size.*` built-in constants.\n// Dependencies SIZE_LARGE, SIZE_NORMAL, SIZE_SMALL\ngetSize(simple string userSize) => result = switch userSize SIZE_LARGE => size.large SIZE_NORMAL => size.normal SIZE_SMALL => size.small => size.auto if ta.rising(close, 3) label.new(bar_index, na, yloc = yloc.abovebar, style = label.style_arrowup, size = getSize(sizeInput)) This is where the script’s core calculations and logic should be\nplaced. Code can be easier to read when variable declarations are placed\nnear the code segment using the variables. Some programmers prefer to\nplace all their non-constant variable declarations at the beginning of\nthis section, which is not always possible for all variables, as some\nmay require some calculations to have been executed before their\ndeclaration. Strategies are easier to read when strategy calls are grouped in the\nsame section of the script. This section should ideally include all the statements producing the\nscript’s visuals, whether they be plots, drawings, background colors,\ncandle-plotting, etc. See the Pine Script user manual’s section on here for more\ninformation on how the relative depth of visuals is determined. Alert code will usually require the script’s calculations to have\nexecuted before it, so it makes sense to put it at the end of the\nscript. A space should be used on both sides of all operators, except unary\noperators ( -1 ). A space is also recommended after all commas and when\nusing named function arguments, as in plot(series = close) : int a = close > open ? 1 : -1\nvar int newLen = 2\nnewLen := min(20, newlen + 1)\nfloat a = -b\nfloat c = d > e ? d - e : d\nint index = bar_index % 2 == 0 ? 1 : 2\nplot(close, color = color.red) Line wrapping can make long lines easier to read. Line wraps are defined\nby using an indentation level that is not a multiple of four, as four\nspaces or a tab are used to define local blocks. Here we use two spaces: plot( series = close, title = \"Close\", color = color.blue, show_last = 10 ) Vertical alignment using tabs or spaces can be useful in code sections\ncontaining many similar lines such as constant declarations or inputs.\nThey can make mass edits much easier using the Pine Editor’s\nmulti-cursor feature ( ctrl + alt + 🠅 ): // Colors used as defaults in inputs.\ncolor COLOR_AQUA = #0080FFff\ncolor COLOR_BLACK = #000000ff\ncolor COLOR_BLUE = #013BCAff\ncolor COLOR_CORAL = #FF8080ff\ncolor COLOR_GOLD = #CCCC00ff Including the type of variables when declaring them is not required.\nHowever, it helps make scripts easier to read, navigate, and understand.\nIt can help clarify the expected types at each point in a script’s\nexecution and distinguish a variable’s declaration (using = ) from its\nreassignments (using := ). Using explicit typing can also make scripts\neasier to debug ."}]}

Pine Script® of version 2 (and higher) is better at\nexplaining errors of this kind. So you can try to switch to version 2 by\nadding a special attribute in the first line. You’ll get line 2: no viable alternative at character '$' : // @version=2\nstudy($) This error message gives a hint on what is wrong. $ stands in place of\nstring with script title. For example: // @version=2\nstudy(\"title\") Same as no viable alternative , but it is known what should be at that\nplace. Example: //@version=6\nindicator(\"My Script\") plot(1) line 3: mismatched input 'plot' expecting 'end of line without line continuation' To fix this you should start line with plot on a new line without an\nindent: //@version=6\nindicator(\"My Script\")\nplot(1) We limit the computation time of loop on every historical bar and\nrealtime tick to protect our servers from infinite or very long loops.\nThis limit also fail-fast indicators that will take too long to compute.\nFor example, if you’ll have 5000 bars, and indicator takes 500\nmilliseconds to compute on each of bars, it would have result in more\nthan 16 minutes of loading: //@version=6\nindicator(\"Loop is too long\", max_bars_back = 101)\ns = 0\nfor i = 1 to 1e3 // to make it longer for j = 0 to 100 if timestamp(2017, 02, 23, 00, 00) <= time[j] and time[j] < timestamp(2017, 02, 23, 23, 59) s := s + 1\nplot(s) It might be possible to optimize algorithm to overcome this error. In\nthis case, algorithm may be optimized like this: //@version=6\nindicator(\"Loop is too long\", max_bars_back = 101)\nbar_back_at(t) => i = 0 step = 51 for j = 1 to 100 if i < 0 i := 0 break if step == 0 break if time[i] >= t i := i + step i else i := i - step i step := step / 2 step i s = 0\nfor i = 1 to 1e3 // to make it longer s := s - bar_back_at(timestamp(2017, 02, 23, 23, 59)) + bar_back_at(timestamp(2017, 02, 23, 00, 00)) s\nplot(s) This error appears if the script is too large to be compiled. A\nstatement var=expression creates a local variable for var . Apart\nfrom this, it is important to note, that auxiliary variables can be\nimplicitly created during the process of a script compilation. The limit\napplies to variables created both explicitly and implicitly. The\nlimitation of 1000 variables is applied to each function individually.\nIn fact, the code placed in a global scope of a script also implicitly\nwrapped up into the main function and the limit of 1000 variables\nbecomes applicable to it. There are few refactorings you can try to\navoid this issue: var1 = expr1\nvar2 = expr2\nvar3 = var1 + var2 can be converted into: var3 = expr1 + expr2 Pine scripts calculate on every bar on the chart, sequentially, left to right, maintaining a historical buffer of values. When a script needs to use a value from a previous bar, it takes that value from the buffer. If a script tries to access a value from a bar further back than the historical buffer extends, it throws this error. As a simple example, if your code includes a line like plot(myVar[500]) , the script keeps a buffer of the last 500 historical values of the myVar variable. This buffer ensures that on every execution, the myVar variable has access to its value 500 bars before the current one. Pine creates the historical buffer in a way that minimizes issues: Initially, the script calculates the historical buffers based on the data from the first several hundred bars. If historical offsets are constant, or if future offsets are not greater than the offsets found during this calculation, the script works without issues. The example above does not cause any issues because the variable is called in the global scope with a constant offset of 500. On the first iteration of the script, it is clear that the buffer size needs to be 500. If the script requests a value outside the buffer during calculation on historical data, the script tries to adjust the buffer to a proper length automatically. The script increases the buffer and restarts. This can happen several times until either the re-run limit is reached or the script calculates without the error. The error can still appear on historical data, but is more likely to occur on realtime data, which is not covered by automatic buffer detection. For example, the following script works when the user first adds it to the chart, but fails with an error when the first realtime tick arrives. This behaviour can be replicated consistently by turning on the Bar Replay feature and pressing Step Forward once. This happens because on historical data, we request close[500] , which establishes the size of the historical buffer as 500. When we request close[1000] on the first realtime bar, the script returns an error because the requested value is outside the buffer: //@version=6\nindicator(\"Error on realtime bars\")\nmyVar = close[barstate.ishistory ? 500 : 1000]\nplot(myVar) To fix this, we need to ensure the historical buffer of our variable (in this case, close ) is always large enough. The maximum possible buffer size for most variables is 5000, and referring further into the past results in a different runtime error. To avoid this error, you can limit the requested offsets with constructions like math.min(myVar, 5000) . The following sections describe different methods to ensure that the historical buffer is of a sufficient size. The max_bars_back() function sets the size of the historical buffer for a particular variable. To fix the issue in the example script above, we need to ensure the buffer for close is at least 1000: //@version=6\nindicator(\"Error on realtime bars\")\nmyVar = close[barstate.ishistory ? 500 : 1000]\nmax_bars_back(close, 1000)\nplot(myVar) The max_bars_back parameter of the indicator() and strategy() functions provides a handy way to increase the historical buffer for all the variables inside of the script. However, increasing the historical buffer for all variables without a specific need for it negatively impacts performance. Using the max_bars_back() function is preferable because it is more precise and more performant. In the past, it used to be a common practice among the Pine community to add max_bars_back = 5000 to all scripts. For scripts that don’t have issues with this error, this doesn’t provide any benefit, but does negatively affect their performance. Another way to set a specific historical buffer is to call the variable on historical data with the maximum buffer required, regardless of whether it’s needed or not at the moment. For example, the script below assigns the myVar variable a close[1000] value on the very first bar of the dataset. It makes no practical difference — on the first bar, all past values are na — but because of this change, the script sets the variable’s buffer to 1000 and can then work on realtime bars without issues: //@version=6\nindicator(\"Error on realtime bars\")\nmyVar = close[barstate.isfirst ? 1000 : barstate.ishistory ? 500 : 1000]\nplot(myVar) A common reason for the historical offset error is creating drawings that are drawn on realtime data, but extend into the past. For example, the code below runs into the runtime error as soon as the first realtime tick arrives: //@version=6\nindicator(\"Realtime error with drawings\") if barstate.isrealtime line.new(bar_index[500], close, bar_index, close) All Pine drawings, even those based on bar_index or chart.point , internally convert their coordinates into time . When the example indicator above is calculating on historical data, it does not draw any lines, and so does not call the time series at all. In this case, the time series takes the default buffer size of 300. On realtime bars, we then request the bar_index[500] value, which is converted into time[500] by the function. But the script doesn’t have a large enough historical buffer, which causes the error to appear. In these cases, the historical buffer for the time series must be enlarged, even if the drawing functions use bar_index exclusively. The easiest fix is to call the max_bars_back() function on the time series, to ensure that its buffer is large enough: //@version=6\nindicator(\"Realtime error with drawings\") max_bars_back(time, 500) if barstate.isrealtime line.new(bar_index[500], close, bar_index, close) The most common cause for this error is returning objects and collections from request.*() functions. Other possible causes include unnecessary drawing updates, excess historical buffer capacity, or inefficient use of max_bars_back . A common source of the “ Memory limits exceeded ” error is returning objects or collections from another chart symbol or timeframe using request.*() functions. When requesting data from other contexts, the data for each bar is copied and stored in memory to allow the script to reference it later in the main context. This can use a lot of memory, depending on the data. Requesting large collections can easily lead to excessive memory consumption. Let’s look at an example script where we request data to calculate the balance of power (BOP) for the symbol at a higher timeframe. Here, the request expression is a custom function that populates a persistent array with our calculated BOP values, returning the full array to the main context on each bar. We intend to use these stored array values to calculate and plot the average BOP in the main context. However, returning every array instance consumes a lot of memory, and so this script can throw a memory error on charts with a sufficiently long history: //@version=6\nindicator(\"BOP array in higher timeframe context\", \"Memory limit demo\") //@variable User-input length for calculating average of BOP values. int avgLength = input.int(5, \"Average BOP Length\", minval = 1) //Returns a copy of the `dataArray` on every bar, which uses a lot of memory.\ndataFunction() => //@variable Persistent array containing the \"balance of power\" (BOP) values for all bars from the higher timeframe. var array<float> dataArray = array.new_float(0) //@variable The \"balance of power\" percentage calculated for the current bar. float bop = (close - open) / (high - low) * 100 dataArray.push(bop) //Return the full collection. dataArray // Request the full BOP array from the 1D timeframe.\narray<float> reqData = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, \"1D\", dataFunction()) // Plot zero line.\nhline(0, \"Zero line\", color.gray, hline.style_dotted) // Latest BOP value and average BOP are calculated in the main context if `reqData` is not `na`.\n//@variable The latest BOP value from the `reqData` array.\nfloat latestValue = na\n//@variable The average of the last `avgLength` BOP values.\nfloat avgBOP = na if not na(reqData) // Retrieve BOP value for the current main context bar. latestValue := reqData.last() // Calculate the average BOP for the most-recent values from the higher timeframe array. //@variable Size of the `reqData` array returned from the higher timeframe. int dataSize = reqData.size() //@variable A subset of the latest values from the `reqData` array. Its size is determined by the `avgLength` set. array<float> lastValues = dataSize >= avgLength ? reqData.slice(dataSize - avgLength, dataSize): reqData avgBOP := lastValues.avg() // Plot the BOP value and average line.\ncolor plotColor = latestValue >= 0 ? color.aqua : color.orange\nplot(latestValue, \"BOP\", plotColor, style = plot.style_columns)\nplot(avgBOP, \"Avg\", color.purple, linewidth = 3) Optimize requests and limit the data returned to the main context to ensure that only the minimum necessary data is stored in memory. If possible, try to return calculated results directly rather than returning the collections themselves, or only return collections conditionally , when they are necessary in the main context. Let’s consider a few common scenarios where scripts need specific data in the main context. If a script needs only the last state of a requested collection in the main context: use an if barstate.islast condition to return a copy of the last bar’s collection only. Here, we modified our script to display only the latest average BOP (a single value), rather than plotting an average line. The updated request function now returns the calculated BOP values directly for each bar, and returns the higher timeframe’s array only on the last bar: //@version=6\nindicator(\"BOP array on last bar\", \"Memory limit demo\") //@variable User-input length for calculating average of BOP values. int avgLength = input.int(5, \"Average BOP Length\", minval = 1) // Returns the calculated `bop` each bar, and a copy of the `dataArray` on the last bar or `na` otherwise.\ndataFunction() => //@variable Persistent array containing the \"balance of power\" (BOP) values for all higher timeframe bars. var array<float> dataArray = array.new_float(0) //@variable The \"balance of power\" percentage calculated for the current higher timeframe bar. float bop = (close - open) / (high - low) * 100 dataArray.push(bop) // Return the collection on the last bar only. if barstate.islast [bop, dataArray] else [bop, na] // Request calculated BOP value, and BOPs array if on last bar, from the higher timeframe.\n[reqValue, reqData] = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, \"1D\", dataFunction()) // Plot zero line.\nhline(0, \"Zero line\", color.gray, hline.style_dotted) // Plot the BOP value for each main context bar.\ncolor plotColor = reqValue >= 0 ? color.aqua : color.orange\nplot(reqValue, \"BOP\", plotColor, style = plot.style_columns) // Calculate the average BOP for most-recent values from the higher timeframe array, and display result in a table cell.\nif not na(reqData) //@variable Size of the `reqData` array returned from the higher timeframe. int dataSize = reqData.size() //@variable A subset of the latest values from the `reqData` array. Its size is determined by the `avgLength` set. array<float> lastValues = dataSize >= avgLength ? reqData.slice(dataSize - avgLength, dataSize): reqData //@variable The average of the last `avgLength` BOP values. float avgBOP = lastValues.avg() // Display latest average value in a single-cell table. var table displayTable = table.new(position.bottom_right, 1, 1, color.purple) displayTable.cell(0, 0, \"Avg of last \" + str.tostring(avgLength) + \" BOPs: \" + str.tostring(avgBOP, \"##.##\") + \"%\", text_color = color.white) If a script needs the result of a calculation on a collection, but does not need the collection itself in the main context, use a user-defined function as the request expression. The function can calculate on the collection in the requested context and return only the result to the main context. For example, we can calculate the average BOP directly within our request function. Therefore, only the calculated values are stored in memory, and the request expression returns a tuple (current BOP and average BOP) to plot the results in the main context: //@version=6\nindicator(\"Return BOP results only\", \"Memory limit demo\") //@variable User-input length for calculating average of BOP values. int avgLength = input.int(5, \"Average BOP Length\", minval = 1) // Returns the calculated `bop` and `avgBOP` values directly.\ndataFunction() => //@variable Persistent array containing the \"balance of power\" (BOP) values for all higher timeframe bars. var array<float> dataArray = array.new_float(0) //@variable The \"balance of power\" percentage calculated for the current higher timeframe bar. float bop = (close - open) / (high - low) * 100 dataArray.push(bop) // Calculate the average BOP for the `avgLength` most-recent values. //@variable Size of the `dataArray`. int dataSize = dataArray.size() //@variable A subset of the latest values from the `dataArray`. Its size is determined by the `avgLength` set. array<float> lastValues = dataSize >= avgLength ? dataArray.slice(dataSize - avgLength, dataSize): dataArray //@variable The average of the last `avgLength` BOP values. float avgBOP = lastValues.avg() //Return the calculated results. [bop, avgBOP] // Request BOP and average BOP values from the higher timeframe.\n[reqValue, reqAverage] = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, \"1D\", dataFunction()) // Plot zero line.\nhline(0, \"Zero line\", color.gray, hline.style_dotted) // Plot the BOP value and average line.\ncolor plotColor = reqValue >= 0 ? color.aqua : color.orange\nplot(reqValue, \"BOP\", plotColor, style = plot.style_columns)\nplot(reqAverage, \"Avg\", color.purple, linewidth = 3) If a script needs the collection itself in the main context, but not for every bar , use conditional expressions to return only the necessary collections to the main context, returning na otherwise. The logic in the main context can then address the na gaps in the series and perform its desired actions on the reduced collections. For example, if we want to calculate the average BOP across each month instead of using a user-input length, we can return the array from the requested context only when there is a change to a new month, returning na otherwise. We then maintain the previous month’s values in the main context to keep a valid array for all intra-month bars: //@version=6\nindicator(\"Monthly BOP array\", \"Memory limit demo\") // Returns the calculated `bop`, and a copy of the `dataArray` on a month's first trading day only, or `na` otherwise.\ndataFunction() => //@variable Persistent array containing the \"balance of power\" (BOP) values for all higher timeframe bars. var array<float> dataArray = array.new_float(0) // When a new month starts, return monthly data array to calculate average BOP for completed month. //@variable Array is `na` except on first trading day of each month, when it contains completed month's BOP values. array<float> returnArray = na //@variable Is `true` on the first bar of each month, `false` otherwise. bool isNewMonth = timeframe.change(\"1M\") if isNewMonth returnArray := dataArray //Clear persistent array to start storing new month's data. if isNewMonth[1] dataArray.clear() //@variable The \"balance of power\" percentage calculated for the current higher timeframe bar. float bop = (close - open) / (high - low) * 100 dataArray.push(bop) //Return the calculated result and the `returnArray`. [bop, returnArray] // Request BOP data from the higher timeframe. (Returns calculated BOP and array of BOP values if new month starts)\n[reqValue, reqData] = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, \"1D\", dataFunction()) // Calculate the average BOP for the most-recent completed month.\n//@variable Persistent array that holds the BOP values for the most-recent completed month.\nvar array<float> completedMonthBOPs = array.new_float(0)\n// If new month starts (i.e., `reqData` is not returned as `na`), then `completedMonthBOPs` is updated with new values.\n// Otherwise, it persists the last valid values for the rest of the month to adjust for `na` gaps.\ncompletedMonthBOPs := na(reqData) ? completedMonthBOPs : reqData\n//@variable The average BOP for the most-recent completed month.\nfloat avgBOP = completedMonthBOPs.avg() // Plot the BOP value and average line.\ncolor plotColor = reqValue >= 0 ? color.aqua : color.orange\nplot(reqValue, \"BOP\", plotColor, style = plot.style_columns)\nplot(avgBOP, \"Avg\", color.purple, linewidth = 3) There are a few other ways to optimize scripts to consume less memory. The request.*() function calls can be computationally expensive, because they retrieve data from other contexts, which can often require significant resource usage. Excessive or inefficient requests can easily cause scripts to reach the memory limit. This memory consumption is especially substantial for scripts requesting data from lower timeframes , where the request function returns an array of multiple lower timeframe bars for each main context bar. For example, requesting “1” data on a “1D” chart returns hundreds of “1” bars for each “1D” bar that executes the request. In the process, the script must allocate memory to store all the requested data arrays so that it can access them later in the main context, which quickly increases the memory consumption. Programmers can reduce the number of requested expressions by: Removing unnecessary request.*() function calls. Changing the requested timeframe to a higher resolution. Condensing multiple requests to the same context into a single request.*() call. Adjusting the request.*() function’s calc_bars_count parameter to restrict the historical data points in the requested context. See this section in the User Manual for more information on optimizing request.*() calls. The max_bars_back parameter of an indicator or strategy sets the size of the history buffer for all series variables in a script. The history buffer determines the number of historical references stored in memory for the script’s built-in and user-defined variables. By default, the Pine Script runtime automatically allocates an appropriate buffer for each variable. Therefore, the max_bars_back parameter and function are only necessary when Pine cannot determine the referencing length of a series . If you encounter this referencing length error, ensure that you set the max_bars_back value appropriately to your script’s needs. Setting a value that’s too large can lead to excessive memory consumption, as it stores unnecessary historical data that the script ultimately doesn’t use. Read up on how to optimize using max_bars_back in our Help Center . The Pine Script runtime automatically creates historical buffers for all variables and function calls in a script. It determines the size of a buffer based on the historical references needed in the code (the references made using the [] history-referencing operator). As the script runs across the dataset, referencing distant points in bar history can cause the script to restart its execution on previous bars to adjust its historical buffer size (see this User Manual article to learn more). Larger buffers in turn lead to an increase in memory consumption and can result in a runtime error. Ensure that scripts are referencing necessary historical values only, and avoid referencing very distant points in history when possible. You can use the indicator() function’s calc_bars_count parameter or the max_bars_back() function to manually restrict the historical data capacity on a script-wide or variable-specific scale. However, be aware that these methods can also cause memory consumption issues of their own if used improperly. Tables only display their last state on a chart. Any updates to a table on historical bars are redundant, because they are not visible. To use the least memory, draw the table once , and fill it on the last bar. Use the var keyword to declare table objects once. Enclose all other setter function calls in a conditional if barstate.islast block for better performance. For more about tables, see this User Manual article . Similar to tables, any updates to drawing objects such as lines and labels that are made on historical bars are never seen by the user. The user only sees updates on realtime bars. Eliminate updates to historical drawings during historical bars wherever possible. For more information, see this User Manual section . Drawing objects such as lines and labels can consume a lot of memory, especially if a script recreates drawings unnecessarily. For example, if a script draws a line from point x1 to x2 , then needs to update the line’s endpoint ( x2 ), it’s more computationally expensive to delete the existing line and redraw a new line from x1 to x3 . Instead, using the setter function line.set_x2() to update the existing line’s endpoint is more efficient. Look for ways to optimize drawing objects in a script: Reduce the number of redrawn objects by initializing drawing object identifiers and using their setter functions to modify properties. Remove unnecessary chart drawings using the delete() functions (e.g., line.delete() and label.delete() ). Reduce an indicator’s maximum drawings limit using the max_lines_count or max_labels_count parameters . The total number of trades or orders in a strategy can impact the memory consumption of a script. For large datasets, reduce the number of unnecessary historical orders stored in memory by limiting the starting point of your strategy. You can filter the strategy’s date by adding a conditional expression that compares the bar time to a specified timestamp to only place entry/exit orders beyond a certain date. See an example of date filtering in strategies here ."}]}

Welcome also to the very active community\nof Pine Script programmers on TradingView. On this page, we present a step-by-step approach that you can follow to gradually become more familiar with indicators and strategies (also called scripts ) written in the Pine Script programming language on TradingView . We will get you started on your journey to: Use some of the tens of thousands of existing scripts on the\nplatform. Read the Pine Script code of existing scripts. Write Pine scripts. If you are already familiar with the use of Pine scripts on TradingView and are now ready to learn how to write your own, then jump to the Writing scripts section of this page. If you are new to our platform, then please read on! If you are interested in using technical indicators or strategies on\nTradingView, you can first start exploring the thousands of indicators\nalready available on our platform. You can access existing indicators on\nthe platform in two different ways: By using the chart’s “Indicators, metrics, and strategies” button. By browsing TradingView’s Community scripts , the largest repository of trading scripts in the world, with more than 150,000 scripts, half of which are free and open-source , which means you can see their Pine Script code. If you can find the tools you need already written for you, it can be a\ngood way to get started and gradually become proficient as a script\nuser, until you are ready to start your programming journey in Pine\nScript. To explore and load scripts from your chart, click the “Indicators, metrics, and strategies” button, or use the forward slash / keyboard shortcut: The dialog box that appears presents different categories of scripts in its left pane: “Favorites” lists the scripts you have “favorited” by clicking on the star that appears to the left of the script name when you hover over it. “Personal” displays the scripts you have written and saved in the Pine Editor. They are saved on TradingView’s servers. “Technicals” groups most TradingView built-in scripts, organized in four categories: “Indicators”, “Strategies”, “Profiles”, and “Patterns”. Most are written in Pine Script and available for free. “Financials” contains all built-in indicators that display financial metrics. The contents of that tab and the subcategories they are grouped into depend on the symbol currently open on the chart. “Community” is where you can search from the more than 150,000 published scripts written by TradingView users. The scripts can be sorted by one of the three different filters — “Editors’ picks” only shows open-source scripts hand-picked by our script moderators, “Top” shows the most popular scripts of all time, and “Trending” displays the most popular scripts that were published recently. “Invite-only” contains the list of the invite-only scripts you have been granted access to by their authors. Here, we selected the “Technicals” tab to see the TradingView built-in indicators: Clicking on one of the listed indicators or strategies loads the script on your chart. Strategy scripts are distinguished from indicators by a special symbol that appears to the right of the script name. To access the Community scripts feed from TradingView’s homepage , select “Indicators and strategies” from the “Community” menu: You can also search for scripts using the homepage’s “Search” field, and filter scripts using different criteria. See this Help Center page explaining the different types of scripts that are available. The scripts feed generates script widgets , which show the title and author of each publication with a preview of the published chart and description. Clicking on a widget opens the script page , which shows the publication’s complete description, an enlarged chart, and any additional release notes. Users can boost, favorite, share, and comment on publications. If it is an open-source script, the source code is also available on the script page. When you find an interesting script in the Community scripts, follow the instructions in the Help Center to load it on your chart . Once a script is loaded on the chart, you can double-click on its name or hover over the name and press the “Settings” button to bring up its “Settings/Inputs” tab: The “Inputs” tab allows you to change the settings which the script’s\nauthor has decided to make editable. You can configure some of the\nscript’s visuals using the “Style” tab of the same dialog box, and\nwhich timeframes the script should appear on using the “Visibility”\ntab. Other settings are available to all scripts from the buttons that appear\nto the right of its name when you mouse over it, and from the “More”\nmenu (the three dots): Reading code written by good programmers is the best way to develop\nyour understanding of the language. This is as true for Pine Script as\nit is for all other programming languages. Finding good open-source Pine\nScript code is relatively easy. These are reliable sources of code\nwritten by good programmers on TradingView: Reading code from Community scripts is easy; if there is no grey or red “lock” icon in the upper-right corner of the script widget, then the script is open-source. By opening the script page, you can read its full source code. To see the code of a TradingView built-in indicator, load the indicator on your chart, then hover over its name and select the “Source code” curly braces icon (if you don’t see it, it’s because the indicator’s source is unavailable). When you click on the {} icon, the Pine Editor opens below the chart and displays the script’s code. If you want to edit the script, you must first select the “Create a working copy” button. You will then be able to modify and save the code. Because the working copy is a different version of the script, you need to use the Editor’s “Add to chart” button to add that new copy to the chart. For example, this image shows the Pine Editor, where we selected to view the source code from the “Bollinger Bands” indicator on our chart. Initially, the script is read-only , as indicated by the orange warning text: You can also open editable versions of the TradingView built-in scripts from the Pine Editor by using the “Create new” > “Built-in…” menu selection: We have built Pine Script to empower both new and experienced traders to create their own trading tools. Although learning a first programming language, like trading, is rarely very easy for anyone, we have designed Pine Script so it is relatively easy to learn for first-time programmers, yet powerful enough for knowledgeable programmers to build tools of moderate complexity. Pine Script allows you to write three types of scripts: Indicators , like RSI, MACD, etc. Strategies , which include logic to issue trading orders and can be backtested and forward-tested. Libraries , which are used by more advanced programmers to package often-used functions that can be reused by other scripts. The next step we recommend is to write your first indicator ."}]}

Because of how the compiler works, you\nwon’t receive a message telling you exactly how many lines of code you\nare over the limit. The only solution now is to break up your if\nstatement into smaller parts (functions or smaller if\nstatements ).\nThe example below shows a reasonably lengthy if\nstatement ;\ntheoretically, this would throw line 4: if statement is too long : //@version=6\nindicator(\"My script\") var e = 0\nif barstate.islast a = 1 b = 2 c = 3 d = 4 e := a + b + c + d plot(e) To fix this code, you could move these lines into their own function: //@version=6\nindicator(\"My script\") var e = 0\ndoSomeWork() => a = 1 b = 2 c = 3 d = 4 result = a + b + c + d if barstate.islast e := doSomeWork() plot(e) The maximum number of securities in script is limited to 40. If you\ndeclare a variable as a request.security function call and then use\nthat variable as input for other variables and calculations, it will not\nresult in multiple request.security calls. But if you will declare a\nfunction that calls request.security --- every call to this function\nwill count as a request.security call. It is not easy to say how many securities will be called looking at the\nsource code. Following example have exactly 3 calls to request.security after compilation: //@version=6\nindicator(\"Securities count\")\na = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, '42', close) // (1) first unique security call\nb = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, '42', close) // same call as above, will not produce new security call after optimizations plot(a)\nplot(a + 2)\nplot(b) sym(p) => // no security call on this line request.security(syminfo.tickerid, p, close)\nplot(sym('D')) // (2) one indirect call to security\nplot(sym('W')) // (3) another indirect call to security c = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, timeframe.period, open) // result of this line is never used, and will be optimized out study($) Usually this error occurs in version 1 Pine scripts, and means that code\nis incorrect. Pine Script® of version 2 (and higher) is better at\nexplaining errors of this kind. So you can try to switch to version 2 by\nadding a special attribute in the first line. You’ll get line 2: no viable alternative at character '$' : // @version=2\nstudy($) This error message gives a hint on what is wrong. $ stands in place of\nstring with script title. For example: // @version=2\nstudy(\"title\") Same as no viable alternative , but it is known what should be at that\nplace. Example: //@version=6\nindicator(\"My Script\") plot(1) line 3: mismatched input 'plot' expecting 'end of line without line continuation' To fix this you should start line with plot on a new line without an\nindent: //@version=6\nindicator(\"My Script\")\nplot(1) We limit the computation time of loop on every historical bar and\nrealtime tick to protect our servers from infinite or very long loops.\nThis limit also fail-fast indicators that will take too long to compute.\nFor example, if you’ll have 5000 bars, and indicator takes 500\nmilliseconds to compute on each of bars, it would have result in more\nthan 16 minutes of loading: //@version=6\nindicator(\"Loop is too long\", max_bars_back = 101)\ns = 0\nfor i = 1 to 1e3 // to make it longer for j = 0 to 100 if timestamp(2017, 02, 23, 00, 00) <= time[j] and time[j] < timestamp(2017, 02, 23, 23, 59) s := s + 1\nplot(s) It might be possible to optimize algorithm to overcome this error. In\nthis case, algorithm may be optimized like this: //@version=6\nindicator(\"Loop is too long\", max_bars_back = 101)\nbar_back_at(t) => i = 0 step = 51 for j = 1 to 100 if i < 0 i := 0 break if step == 0 break if time[i] >= t i := i + step i else i := i - step i step := step / 2 step i s = 0\nfor i = 1 to 1e3 // to make it longer s := s - bar_back_at(timestamp(2017, 02, 23, 23, 59)) + bar_back_at(timestamp(2017, 02, 23, 00, 00)) s\nplot(s) This error appears if the script is too large to be compiled. A\nstatement var=expression creates a local variable for var . Apart\nfrom this, it is important to note, that auxiliary variables can be\nimplicitly created during the process of a script compilation. The limit\napplies to variables created both explicitly and implicitly. The\nlimitation of 1000 variables is applied to each function individually.\nIn fact, the code placed in a global scope of a script also implicitly\nwrapped up into the main function and the limit of 1000 variables\nbecomes applicable to it. There are few refactorings you can try to\navoid this issue: var1 = expr1\nvar2 = expr2\nvar3 = var1 + var2 can be converted into: var3 = expr1 + expr2 Pine scripts calculate on every bar on the chart, sequentially, left to right, maintaining a historical buffer of values. When a script needs to use a value from a previous bar, it takes that value from the buffer. If a script tries to access a value from a bar further back than the historical buffer extends, it throws this error. As a simple example, if your code includes a line like plot(myVar[500]) , the script keeps a buffer of the last 500 historical values of the myVar variable. This buffer ensures that on every execution, the myVar variable has access to its value 500 bars before the current one. Pine creates the historical buffer in a way that minimizes issues: Initially, the script calculates the historical buffers based on the data from the first several hundred bars. If historical offsets are constant, or if future offsets are not greater than the offsets found during this calculation, the script works without issues. The example above does not cause any issues because the variable is called in the global scope with a constant offset of 500. On the first iteration of the script, it is clear that the buffer size needs to be 500. If the script requests a value outside the buffer during calculation on historical data, the script tries to adjust the buffer to a proper length automatically. The script increases the buffer and restarts. This can happen several times until either the re-run limit is reached or the script calculates without the error. The error can still appear on historical data, but is more likely to occur on realtime data, which is not covered by automatic buffer detection. For example, the following script works when the user first adds it to the chart, but fails with an error when the first realtime tick arrives. This behaviour can be replicated consistently by turning on the Bar Replay feature and pressing Step Forward once. This happens because on historical data, we request close[500] , which establishes the size of the historical buffer as 500. When we request close[1000] on the first realtime bar, the script returns an error because the requested value is outside the buffer: //@version=6\nindicator(\"Error on realtime bars\")\nmyVar = close[barstate.ishistory ? 500 : 1000]\nplot(myVar) To fix this, we need to ensure the historical buffer of our variable (in this case, close ) is always large enough. The maximum possible buffer size for most variables is 5000, and referring further into the past results in a different runtime error. To avoid this error, you can limit the requested offsets with constructions like math.min(myVar, 5000) . The following sections describe different methods to ensure that the historical buffer is of a sufficient size. The max_bars_back() function sets the size of the historical buffer for a particular variable. To fix the issue in the example script above, we need to ensure the buffer for close is at least 1000: //@version=6\nindicator(\"Error on realtime bars\")\nmyVar = close[barstate.ishistory ? 500 : 1000]\nmax_bars_back(close, 1000)\nplot(myVar) The max_bars_back parameter of the indicator() and strategy() functions provides a handy way to increase the historical buffer for all the variables inside of the script. However, increasing the historical buffer for all variables without a specific need for it negatively impacts performance. Using the max_bars_back() function is preferable because it is more precise and more performant. In the past, it used to be a common practice among the Pine community to add max_bars_back = 5000 to all scripts. For scripts that don’t have issues with this error, this doesn’t provide any benefit, but does negatively affect their performance. Another way to set a specific historical buffer is to call the variable on historical data with the maximum buffer required, regardless of whether it’s needed or not at the moment. For example, the script below assigns the myVar variable a close[1000] value on the very first bar of the dataset. It makes no practical difference — on the first bar, all past values are na — but because of this change, the script sets the variable’s buffer to 1000 and can then work on realtime bars without issues: //@version=6\nindicator(\"Error on realtime bars\")\nmyVar = close[barstate.isfirst ? 1000 : barstate.ishistory ? 500 : 1000]\nplot(myVar) A common reason for the historical offset error is creating drawings that are drawn on realtime data, but extend into the past. For example, the code below runs into the runtime error as soon as the first realtime tick arrives: //@version=6\nindicator(\"Realtime error with drawings\") if barstate.isrealtime line.new(bar_index[500], close, bar_index, close) All Pine drawings, even those based on bar_index or chart.point , internally convert their coordinates into time . When the example indicator above is calculating on historical data, it does not draw any lines, and so does not call the time series at all. In this case, the time series takes the default buffer size of 300. On realtime bars, we then request the bar_index[500] value, which is converted into time[500] by the function. But the script doesn’t have a large enough historical buffer, which causes the error to appear. In these cases, the historical buffer for the time series must be enlarged, even if the drawing functions use bar_index exclusively. The easiest fix is to call the max_bars_back() function on the time series, to ensure that its buffer is large enough: //@version=6\nindicator(\"Realtime error with drawings\") max_bars_back(time, 500) if barstate.isrealtime line.new(bar_index[500], close, bar_index, close) The most common cause for this error is returning objects and collections from request.*() functions. Other possible causes include unnecessary drawing updates, excess historical buffer capacity, or inefficient use of max_bars_back . A common source of the “ Memory limits exceeded ” error is returning objects or collections from another chart symbol or timeframe using request.*() functions. When requesting data from other contexts, the data for each bar is copied and stored in memory to allow the script to reference it later in the main context. This can use a lot of memory, depending on the data. Requesting large collections can easily lead to excessive memory consumption. Let’s look at an example script where we request data to calculate the balance of power (BOP) for the symbol at a higher timeframe. Here, the request expression is a custom function that populates a persistent array with our calculated BOP values, returning the full array to the main context on each bar. We intend to use these stored array values to calculate and plot the average BOP in the main context. However, returning every array instance consumes a lot of memory, and so this script can throw a memory error on charts with a sufficiently long history: //@version=6\nindicator(\"BOP array in higher timeframe context\", \"Memory limit demo\") //@variable User-input length for calculating average of BOP values. int avgLength = input.int(5, \"Average BOP Length\", minval = 1) //Returns a copy of the `dataArray` on every bar, which uses a lot of memory.\ndataFunction() => //@variable Persistent array containing the \"balance of power\" (BOP) values for all bars from the higher timeframe. var array<float> dataArray = array.new_float(0) //@variable The \"balance of power\" percentage calculated for the current bar. float bop = (close - open) / (high - low) * 100 dataArray.push(bop) //Return the full collection. dataArray // Request the full BOP array from the 1D timeframe.\narray<float> reqData = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, \"1D\", dataFunction()) // Plot zero line.\nhline(0, \"Zero line\", color.gray, hline.style_dotted) // Latest BOP value and average BOP are calculated in the main context if `reqData` is not `na`.\n//@variable The latest BOP value from the `reqData` array.\nfloat latestValue = na\n//@variable The average of the last `avgLength` BOP values.\nfloat avgBOP = na if not na(reqData) // Retrieve BOP value for the current main context bar. latestValue := reqData.last() // Calculate the average BOP for the most-recent values from the higher timeframe array. //@variable Size of the `reqData` array returned from the higher timeframe. int dataSize = reqData.size() //@variable A subset of the latest values from the `reqData` array. Its size is determined by the `avgLength` set. array<float> lastValues = dataSize >= avgLength ? reqData.slice(dataSize - avgLength, dataSize): reqData avgBOP := lastValues.avg() // Plot the BOP value and average line.\ncolor plotColor = latestValue >= 0 ? color.aqua : color.orange\nplot(latestValue, \"BOP\", plotColor, style = plot.style_columns)\nplot(avgBOP, \"Avg\", color.purple, linewidth = 3) Optimize requests and limit the data returned to the main context to ensure that only the minimum necessary data is stored in memory. If possible, try to return calculated results directly rather than returning the collections themselves, or only return collections conditionally , when they are necessary in the main context. Let’s consider a few common scenarios where scripts need specific data in the main context. If a script needs only the last state of a requested collection in the main context: use an if barstate.islast condition to return a copy of the last bar’s collection only. Here, we modified our script to display only the latest average BOP (a single value), rather than plotting an average line. The updated request function now returns the calculated BOP values directly for each bar, and returns the higher timeframe’s array only on the last bar: //@version=6\nindicator(\"BOP array on last bar\", \"Memory limit demo\") //@variable User-input length for calculating average of BOP values. int avgLength = input.int(5, \"Average BOP Length\", minval = 1) // Returns the calculated `bop` each bar, and a copy of the `dataArray` on the last bar or `na` otherwise.\ndataFunction() => //@variable Persistent array containing the \"balance of power\" (BOP) values for all higher timeframe bars. var array<float> dataArray = array.new_float(0) //@variable The \"balance of power\" percentage calculated for the current higher timeframe bar. float bop = (close - open) / (high - low) * 100 dataArray.push(bop) // Return the collection on the last bar only. if barstate.islast [bop, dataArray] else [bop, na] // Request calculated BOP value, and BOPs array if on last bar, from the higher timeframe.\n[reqValue, reqData] = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, \"1D\", dataFunction()) // Plot zero line.\nhline(0, \"Zero line\", color.gray, hline.style_dotted) // Plot the BOP value for each main context bar.\ncolor plotColor = reqValue >= 0 ? color.aqua : color.orange\nplot(reqValue, \"BOP\", plotColor, style = plot.style_columns) // Calculate the average BOP for most-recent values from the higher timeframe array, and display result in a table cell.\nif not na(reqData) //@variable Size of the `reqData` array returned from the higher timeframe. int dataSize = reqData.size() //@variable A subset of the latest values from the `reqData` array. Its size is determined by the `avgLength` set. array<float> lastValues = dataSize >= avgLength ? reqData.slice(dataSize - avgLength, dataSize): reqData //@variable The average of the last `avgLength` BOP values. float avgBOP = lastValues.avg() // Display latest average value in a single-cell table. var table displayTable = table.new(position.bottom_right, 1, 1, color.purple) displayTable.cell(0, 0, \"Avg of last \" + str.tostring(avgLength) + \" BOPs: \" + str.tostring(avgBOP, \"##.##\") + \"%\", text_color = color.white) If a script needs the result of a calculation on a collection, but does not need the collection itself in the main context, use a user-defined function as the request expression. The function can calculate on the collection in the requested context and return only the result to the main context. For example, we can calculate the average BOP directly within our request function. Therefore, only the calculated values are stored in memory, and the request expression returns a tuple (current BOP and average BOP) to plot the results in the main context: //@version=6\nindicator(\"Return BOP results only\", \"Memory limit demo\") //@variable User-input length for calculating average of BOP values. int avgLength = input.int(5, \"Average BOP Length\", minval = 1) // Returns the calculated `bop` and `avgBOP` values directly.\ndataFunction() => //@variable Persistent array containing the \"balance of power\" (BOP) values for all higher timeframe bars. var array<float> dataArray = array.new_float(0) //@variable The \"balance of power\" percentage calculated for the current higher timeframe bar. float bop = (close - open) / (high - low) * 100 dataArray.push(bop) // Calculate the average BOP for the `avgLength` most-recent values. //@variable Size of the `dataArray`. int dataSize = dataArray.size() //@variable A subset of the latest values from the `dataArray`. Its size is determined by the `avgLength` set. array<float> lastValues = dataSize >= avgLength ? dataArray.slice(dataSize - avgLength, dataSize): dataArray //@variable The average of the last `avgLength` BOP values. float avgBOP = lastValues.avg() //Return the calculated results. [bop, avgBOP] // Request BOP and average BOP values from the higher timeframe.\n[reqValue, reqAverage] = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, \"1D\", dataFunction()) // Plot zero line.\nhline(0, \"Zero line\", color.gray, hline.style_dotted) // Plot the BOP value and average line.\ncolor plotColor = reqValue >= 0 ? color.aqua : color.orange\nplot(reqValue, \"BOP\", plotColor, style = plot.style_columns)\nplot(reqAverage, \"Avg\", color.purple, linewidth = 3) If a script needs the collection itself in the main context, but not for every bar , use conditional expressions to return only the necessary collections to the main context, returning na otherwise. The logic in the main context can then address the na gaps in the series and perform its desired actions on the reduced collections. For example, if we want to calculate the average BOP across each month instead of using a user-input length, we can return the array from the requested context only when there is a change to a new month, returning na otherwise. We then maintain the previous month’s values in the main context to keep a valid array for all intra-month bars: //@version=6\nindicator(\"Monthly BOP array\", \"Memory limit demo\") // Returns the calculated `bop`, and a copy of the `dataArray` on a month's first trading day only, or `na` otherwise.\ndataFunction() => //@variable Persistent array containing the \"balance of power\" (BOP) values for all higher timeframe bars. var array<float> dataArray = array.new_float(0) // When a new month starts, return monthly data array to calculate average BOP for completed month. //@variable Array is `na` except on first trading day of each month, when it contains completed month's BOP values. array<float> returnArray = na //@variable Is `true` on the first bar of each month, `false` otherwise. bool isNewMonth = timeframe.change(\"1M\") if isNewMonth returnArray := dataArray //Clear persistent array to start storing new month's data. if isNewMonth[1] dataArray.clear() //@variable The \"balance of power\" percentage calculated for the current higher timeframe bar. float bop = (close - open) / (high - low) * 100 dataArray.push(bop) //Return the calculated result and the `returnArray`. [bop, returnArray] // Request BOP data from the higher timeframe. (Returns calculated BOP and array of BOP values if new month starts)\n[reqValue, reqData] = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, \"1D\", dataFunction()) // Calculate the average BOP for the most-recent completed month.\n//@variable Persistent array that holds the BOP values for the most-recent completed month.\nvar array<float> completedMonthBOPs = array.new_float(0)\n// If new month starts (i.e., `reqData` is not returned as `na`), then `completedMonthBOPs` is updated with new values.\n// Otherwise, it persists the last valid values for the rest of the month to adjust for `na` gaps.\ncompletedMonthBOPs := na(reqData) ? completedMonthBOPs : reqData\n//@variable The average BOP for the most-recent completed month.\nfloat avgBOP = completedMonthBOPs.avg() // Plot the BOP value and average line.\ncolor plotColor = reqValue >= 0 ? color.aqua : color.orange\nplot(reqValue, \"BOP\", plotColor, style = plot.style_columns)\nplot(avgBOP, \"Avg\", color.purple, linewidth = 3) There are a few other ways to optimize scripts to consume less memory. The request.*() function calls can be computationally expensive, because they retrieve data from other contexts, which can often require significant resource usage. Excessive or inefficient requests can easily cause scripts to reach the memory limit. This memory consumption is especially substantial for scripts requesting data from lower timeframes , where the request function returns an array of multiple lower timeframe bars for each main context bar. For example, requesting “1” data on a “1D” chart returns hundreds of “1” bars for each “1D” bar that executes the request. In the process, the script must allocate memory to store all the requested data arrays so that it can access them later in the main context, which quickly increases the memory consumption. Programmers can reduce the number of requested expressions by: Removing unnecessary request.*() function calls. Changing the requested timeframe to a higher resolution. Condensing multiple requests to the same context into a single request.*() call. Adjusting the request.*() function’s calc_bars_count parameter to restrict the historical data points in the requested context. See this section in the User Manual for more information on optimizing request.*() calls. The max_bars_back parameter of an indicator or strategy sets the size of the history buffer for all series variables in a script. The history buffer determines the number of historical references stored in memory for the script’s built-in and user-defined variables. By default, the Pine Script runtime automatically allocates an appropriate buffer for each variable. Therefore, the max_bars_back parameter and function are only necessary when Pine cannot determine the referencing length of a series . If you encounter this referencing length error, ensure that you set the max_bars_back value appropriately to your script’s needs. Setting a value that’s too large can lead to excessive memory consumption, as it stores unnecessary historical data that the script ultimately doesn’t use. Read up on how to optimize using max_bars_back in our Help Center . The Pine Script runtime automatically creates historical buffers for all variables and function calls in a script. It determines the size of a buffer based on the historical references needed in the code (the references made using the [] history-referencing operator). As the script runs across the dataset, referencing distant points in bar history can cause the script to restart its execution on previous bars to adjust its historical buffer size (see this User Manual article to learn more). Larger buffers in turn lead to an increase in memory consumption and can result in a runtime error. Ensure that scripts are referencing necessary historical values only, and avoid referencing very distant points in history when possible. You can use the indicator() function’s calc_bars_count parameter or the max_bars_back() function to manually restrict the historical data capacity on a script-wide or variable-specific scale. However, be aware that these methods can also cause memory consumption issues of their own if used improperly. Tables only display their last state on a chart. Any updates to a table on historical bars are redundant, because they are not visible. To use the least memory, draw the table once , and fill it on the last bar. Use the var keyword to declare table objects once. Enclose all other setter function calls in a conditional if barstate.islast block for better performance. For more about tables, see this User Manual article . Similar to tables, any updates to drawing objects such as lines and labels that are made on historical bars are never seen by the user. The user only sees updates on realtime bars. Eliminate updates to historical drawings during historical bars wherever possible. For more information, see this User Manual section . Drawing objects such as lines and labels can consume a lot of memory, especially if a script recreates drawings unnecessarily. For example, if a script draws a line from point x1 to x2 , then needs to update the line’s endpoint ( x2 ), it’s more computationally expensive to delete the existing line and redraw a new line from x1 to x3 . Instead, using the setter function line.set_x2() to update the existing line’s endpoint is more efficient. Look for ways to optimize drawing objects in a script: Reduce the number of redrawn objects by initializing drawing object identifiers and using their setter functions to modify properties. Remove unnecessary chart drawings using the delete() functions (e.g., line.delete() and label.delete() ). Reduce an indicator’s maximum drawings limit using the max_lines_count or max_labels_count parameters . The total number of trades or orders in a strategy can impact the memory consumption of a script. For large datasets, reduce the number of unnecessary historical orders stored in memory by limiting the starting point of your strategy. You can filter the strategy’s date by adding a conditional expression that compares the bar time to a specified timestamp to only place entry/exit orders beyond a certain date. See an example of date filtering in strategies here ."}]}

Because close built-in variable is\nalways a value that corresponds to a visible bar (or candle) on the\nchart. So, how do we get the real OHLC prices in Pine Script® code, if current\nchart type is non-standard? We should use request.security function in\ncombination with ticker.new function.

Each guide details sequential changes; for example, the To Pine Script version 6 page assumes that the script is already written in Pine v5. Scripts written in every Pine Script version starting from v3 can be converted to the next version automatically using the converter available in the “Manage Scripts” menu: A script can be converted only if its code compiles successfully. In rare cases, converting a valid script automatically can result in a script with compilation errors. In that case, resolve the errors using the information in the appropriate article."}]}
